## Writing Guidelines

### Voice & Tone

- **Active voice**: "Sends notifications" not "Notifications are sent"
- **Lead with value**: Start with benefit, then explain how
- **Be specific**: "Responds in <2 seconds" not "Fast response times"

### Content Rules

- **Real examples**: Concrete scenarios, not abstract descriptions
- **No jargon**: Write for intelligent non-technical readers
- **Honest limitations**: Builds trust, prevents misuse
- **User-focused benefits**: Outcomes over features

### Structure

- **Value proposition**: One sentence that captures the essence
- **The Problem**: Pain point from Q1 answer
- **How It Helps**: 3-5 capabilities with examples
- **Use Case**: End-to-end scenario
- **Key Benefits**: 3-5 bullet points, outcome-focused
- **Limitations**: From Q7, honest and direct

## Example

```markdown
# WhatsApp Service

Turn WhatsApp messages into organized todos — capture thoughts wherever you are.

## The Problem

Ideas strike at inconvenient times — driving, walking, in meetings. By the time you reach a computer, you've forgotten half of them. Traditional task apps require opening an app, navigating to the right list, and typing everything out.

## How It Helps

### Instant Capture via WhatsApp

Send a message, get a todo. No app switching, no friction.

**Example:** Driving to work, you remember to call the dentist. Send "call dentist tuesday" — it's captured and waiting when you get home.

### Voice Note Transcription

Speak your thoughts, get text. Voice notes are automatically transcribed and converted to todos.

**Example:** On a walk, you have an idea for your presentation. Record a 30-second voice note — it becomes a detailed todo with the full transcription.

### Automatic Categorization

AI analyzes your input and suggests tags, priorities, and due dates.

**Example:** "Buy milk" gets tagged #shopping, "Finish report by Friday" gets due date and #work tag.

## Use Case

You're commuting when you remember three things: buy birthday gift, email the lawyer, and review the contract. You send one WhatsApp message: "Buy gift for Sarah's birthday, email lawyer about contract, review contract by Thursday."

WhatsApp Service splits this into three todos, assigns priorities based on deadlines, and suggests relevant tags. When you open your dashboard, everything is organized and actionable.

## Key Benefits

- Zero friction capture from any location
- No context switching — stay in WhatsApp
- Automatic organization saves manual work
- Voice support for hands-free capture

## Limitations

- Requires WhatsApp (no Telegram/SMS yet)
- Voice transcription limited to 10 per month on free tier
- AI categorization may need manual adjustment
