# Linear Issue Management

Manage Linear issues, branches, and PRs with enforced workflow and cross-linking.

**Team:** `IntexuraOS` — ALWAYS use this exact team name for all Linear API calls. Never guess.

**Project Key:** `INT-` (e.g., `INT-123`, `INT-144`). All issue references use generic `LIN-XXX` placeholders, but for this project always use `INT-XXX`.

## Usage

```
/linear                           # NON-INTERACTIVE: Pick random Todo issue
/linear <task description>        # Create new issue
/linear INT-123                   # Work on existing issue
/linear <sentrybox-url>           # Create issue from a SentryBox error
```

## Core Mandates (6 Essential Rules)

1. **Test Requirements First**: EVERY issue MUST have a "Test Requirements" section with specific test cases. No exceptions.
2. **Branch First**: EVERY task starts with branch from `origin/development`. Working on `main` = task failure.
3. **CI Gate**: `pnpm run ci:tracked` MUST pass before commit. NON-NEGOTIABLE.
4. **State Management**: Issues transition: Backlog → In Progress → In Review. Never skip states.
5. **Cross-Linking**: Every issue links Linear ↔ GitHub ↔ SentryBox. PRs require `[INT-XXX]` in title.
6. **Never Assign Issues**: NEVER set `assignee`, `assigneeId`, or `delegate` on any Linear issue. Assignment is exclusively the user's responsibility. Enforced by PreToolUse hook.

### Execution Behaviors

| Behavior       | Rule                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Fail Fast      | If Linear/GitHub/GCloud unavailable, STOP immediately                                |
| No Guessing    | When ambiguous, ASK the user                                                         |
| One at a Time  | Complete PR for each issue before starting next                                      |
| Checkpoint     | After issue completion, STOP and wait for instruction                                |
| Done Forbidden | Maximum agent state is "In Review" (never "QA" or "Done")                            |
| No Assignment  | NEVER set assignee or delegate on issues. User-only responsibility. Enforced by hook |
| 95% Coverage   | All listed tests MUST be implemented                                                 |
| Auto-Complete  | After implementation: CI → commit → push → PR → Linear. Never ask "Should I commit?" |

---

### Parent Execution Mode (Issues with Children)

When working on parent issues that have child subissues:

1. **Single Branch/PR**: One branch and one PR for the parent, covering all children
2. **Continuous Execution**: Execute ALL children without stopping between them
3. **PR Continuity**: Create PR early, update after EACH child with status
4. **Silent Transitions**: No "Next Step: INT-YYY" announcements between children

---

## Test Requirements Quality Gate

**Every implementation issue (features, bugs, refactors) MUST include test requirements as the FIRST section.**

This applies to:

- Parent issues
- ALL child issues created during splitting
- Standalone issues

### Required Format

```markdown
## Test Requirements (MANDATORY - implement first)

**Backend Tests (`apps/<service>/src/__tests__/`):**

| Test | Endpoint/Function | Scenario        | Expected        |
| ---- | ----------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Name | What is tested    | Input/condition | Output/behavior |

**Frontend Tests (if applicable):**

- Test case 1
- Test case 2
```

### Why This Matters

- LLM agents skip tests when not explicitly listed
- "Add tests" is too vague — specific test cases ensure coverage
- Test-first thinking catches design issues early
- Acceptance criteria without test specs are incomplete

## Invocation Detection

The skill automatically detects intent from input:

| Input Pattern                                                                         | Type                  | Workflow                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/linear` (no args)                                                                   | Random Todo           | [random-todo.md](workflows/random-todo.md)               |
| `/linear <task description>`                                                          | Create New            | [create-issue.md](workflows/create-issue.md)             |
| `/linear INT-<number>`                                                                | Work Existing         | [work-existing.md](workflows/work-existing.md)\*         |
| `/linear https://home-dev.taild6ad57.ts.net:8443/organizations/intexuraos/issues/...` | SentryBox Integration | [sentry-integration.md](workflows/sentry-integration.md) |

\*Routes to [parent-execution.md](workflows/parent-execution.md) if issue has child subissues

### Note: Backlog → Todo Transition

**`/linear` (no args) queries "Todo" state**, but `create-issue.md` creates issues in **"Backlog" state**.

This gap is intentional:

- **Backlog**: Raw issues, may need triage/refinement
- **Todo**: Prioritized and ready for work

**To make an issue appear in `/linear` (no args) queue:**

1. Move issue from Backlog → Todo in Linear UI (manual triage), OR
2. Use `/linear INT-XXX` to work on a specific issue directly (bypasses queue)

> ⚠️ **Important:** Issues created via `/linear <description>` will NOT appear in the random queue until manually triaged to "Todo" state.

**Two-cycle pattern (cron mode):**

1. First invocation: `/linear INT-XXX` runs Phase 1, adds `code-task` label, STOPS
2. Second invocation: `/linear INT-XXX` runs Phase 2 (execution)

## Auto-Splitting Detection

For complex multi-step tasks, auto-splitting is triggered when:

1. Issue description has numbered phases (Phase 1, Phase 2...)
2. Issue description has >5 checkbox items
3. Issue description >2000 characters with clear sections
4. User explicitly says "split this into subtasks"

When detected, see: [plan-splitting.md](workflows/plan-splitting.md)

## Tool Verification (Fail Fast)

Before ANY operation, verify all required tools:

| Tool       | Verification Command         | Purpose          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Linear MCP | `mcp__linear__list_teams`    | Issue management |
| GitHub CLI | `gh auth status`             | PR creation      |
| GCloud     | Service account verification | Firestore access |

### GCloud Verification

**Service account key location:** `~/.config/gcloud/sa-key.json`

1. Check if credentials file exists
2. If `gcloud auth list` shows no active account, activate service account
3. Verify authentication

**You are NEVER "unauthenticated" if the service account key file exists.**

### Failure Handling

If ANY required tool is unavailable, **ABORT immediately**:

```
ERROR: /linear cannot proceed - <tool-name> unavailable

Required for: <purpose>
Fix: <fix-command>

Aborting.
```

## Query Safety (Context Overflow Prevention)

**CRITICAL:** Linear MCP can return massive payloads that crash context. Follow these rules strictly.

### Maximum Limits

| Query Type           | Max Limit | Reason                               |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Broad text search    | **10**    | Text search matches many issues      |
| Specific ID search   | 10        | Targeted, predictable size           |
| `parentId` query     | 20        | Known scope (children of one parent) |
| Status/state filter  | 10        | Can still match many issues          |
| No filter (list all) | **NEVER** | Unbounded, guaranteed overflow       |

### Safe vs Dangerous Queries

```typescript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN - broad search + high limit = context crash
list_issues({ query: 'tier', limit: 50 });
list_issues({ query: 'fix', limit: 50 });
list_issues({ limit: 100 });

// ✅ SAFE - specific issue ID
list_issues({ query: 'INT-445', limit: 10 });

// ✅ SAFE - query children by parentId
list_issues({ parentId: '<parent-uuid>', limit: 20 });

// ✅ SAFE - targeted state filter
list_issues({ state: 'Todo', team: 'IntexuraOS', limit: 10 });
```

### Finding Child Issues

**IMPORTANT:** `get_issue({ includeRelations: true })` does NOT return children.

It only returns: `blocks`, `blockedBy`, `relatedTo`, `duplicateOf`.

**To find children:**

```typescript
// Step 1: Get parent UUID
const parent = await get_issue({ id: 'INT-445' });

// Step 2: Query by parentId
const children = await list_issues({ parentId: parent.id, limit: 20 });
```

### If Context Overflows

1. Run `/clear` to reset context
2. Use specific issue ID queries only
3. Never retry the broad query that caused the crash

## GitHub Integration (Critical)

For PRs to appear as attachments in Linear UI:

1. **Branch name MUST contain Linear issue ID** - e.g., `fix/INT-123`
2. **PR title MUST contain Linear issue ID** - e.g., `[INT-123] Fix auth`

When both conditions are met, GitHub integration automatically attaches PR to Linear issue.

## Two-Phase Execution Model

All issue work follows a two-phase model (both interactive and worker modes):

| Phase   | Trigger               | Purpose             | Output                                                       |
| ------- | --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Phase 1 | No `code-task` label  | Design & Validation | Enriched issue (in-place), subissues if complex, label added |
| Phase 2 | Has `code-task` label | Strict Execution    | Code, tests, PR, Linear "In Review"                          |

**Labels control phase:**

- `code-task` → Phase 2 (execute)
- `unclear` → Stop, await human review

**Phase 1 outputs (in-place on Linear issue):**

1. Enriched description with Unified Issue Template sections
2. Subissues with `code-task` label (if complex)
3. `code-task` or `unclear` label added to parent
4. Optional: Design doc PR for complex architectural decisions

See: [Two-Phase Execution Reference](reference/two-phase-execution.md)

## Verbose Transition Logging (MANDATORY)

**All workflow transitions MUST be printed for debugging purposes.**
