# Cross-Linking Protocol

All issues must be linked between systems for full traceability.

## Link Directions

| Direction          | Method                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Linear → GitHub    | PR title contains `INT-XXX` (enables auto-attachment)              |
| GitHub → Linear    | GitHub integration attaches PR (when title + branch have issue ID) |
| Linear → GitHub    | `Fixes INT-XXX` in PR body (for issue closing behavior)            |
| SentryBox → Linear | Code Agent webhook creates an issue with the SentryBox URL         |
| Linear → SentryBox | The issue description retains the original SentryBox evidence URL  |

## GitHub Integration (Automatic Attachment)

**CRITICAL:** For PRs to appear as attachments in Linear UI (visible in `attachments` array):

### Required Conditions

Any **single** method is sufficient for Linear to auto-link a PR:

1. **Branch name contains Linear issue ID**
   - ✅ `fix/INT-123`
   - ✅ `feature/INT-44-add-tests`

2. **PR title contains Linear issue ID**
   - ✅ `[INT-123] Fix auth`
   - ✅ `INT-44: Add tests`

3. **PR description contains magic words**
   - ✅ `Fixes INT-123` / `Closes INT-123`

Using **any one** of these is enough — they work independently. Using multiple is fine but not required.

### What Happens When Conditions Are Met

- PR automatically appears in Linear issue's `attachments` array
- Issue state transitions automatically: `In Progress` → `In Review` → `QA`
- Bidirectional link established (click PR from Linear, see issue from GitHub)
- **No manual comment needed** — attachment is the canonical link

### What Happens When Conditions Are NOT Met

- PR does NOT attach to Linear issue
- Only manual comment with PR URL (not visible as attachment)
- No automatic state transitions
- Must manually update Linear state

## Verification After PR Creation

Always verify after creating a PR:

```bash
# Check Linear issue has PR under "Pull requests" section
# If missing, the naming convention wasn't followed
```

## SentryBox Integration

### Creating a Linear Issue from SentryBox

The Code Agent webhook creates the Linear issue automatically. Its description includes:

- SentryBox issue URL
- organization and project
- SentryBox issue ID
- webhook resource and action
- triggering event ID

Do not create a second Linear issue manually and do not attempt to write comments back to
SentryBox. The retained SentryBox URL in the generated issue is the canonical evidence link.

## PR Body Links

Include these in every PR:

```markdown
## Cross-References

- **Linear Issue**: [INT-XXX](https://linear.app/pbuchman/issue/INT-XXX)
- **SentryBox Issue** (if applicable): [Error Title](https://<ERROR_HUB_HOST>/organizations/<org>/issues/<id>/)
```

## Why Comments Don't Work

Adding PR URL as a comment only adds text — it doesn't create the attachment relationship.

The GitHub integration establishes the bidirectional link when the issue ID appears in **any** of: branch name, PR title, or PR description (magic words). Any single method is sufficient.

## Example: Proper vs Improper Linking

### Proper (PR in attachments) ✅

```
Branch: fix/INT-42-auth-bug
PR Title: [INT-42] Fix authentication token not refreshing
Result: PR appears in Linear issue attachments
```

### Improper (Only comment link) ❌

```
Branch: fix/auth-bug
PR Title: Fix authentication token not refreshing
Result: Must manually add PR URL as comment
```
