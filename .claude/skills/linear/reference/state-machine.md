# Linear State Machine

Automatic state transitions enforced by the Linear skill.

                    +-------------------------+
                    |        Backlog          |  (Initial state for new issues)
                    +-----------+-------------+
                                |
                    /linear INT-123 called
                                |
                                v
                    +-------------------------+
                    |      In Progress        |  (Branch created, active work)
                    +-----------+-------------+
                                |
                    gh pr create called
                                |

                    |       In Review         |  (PR link added, awaiting review)
                    +-----------+-------------+
                                |
                +---------------+---------------+

                v                               v

                |
        User explicitly
        requests Done

                v
    +-------------------+
    |        Done       |  (Only on explicit user instruction)
    +-------------------+
```

## State Transition Triggers

| Trigger                                    | From         | To          | Action                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `/linear INT-123` called                   | Backlog/Todo | In Progress | Create branch with issue ID in name |
| `gh pr create` called (title has issue ID) | In Progress  | In Review   | GitHub integration auto-attaches PR |
| PR approved                                | In Review    | QA          | Move to QA state for testing        |
| PR has review changes                      | In Review    | In Progress | Update Linear state                 |
| User explicitly requests "move to Done"    | Any          | Done        | Close Linear issue                  |

## Important Notes

### Default Post-Approval State

When a PR is approved, the default transition is to **QA** (not Done). This allows for:

- Manual testing verification
- QA review
- Final sign-off

Only move to **Done** when user explicitly requests it.

### GitHub Integration Requirement

GitHub integration only works when **BOTH**:

1. Branch name contains Linear issue ID (e.g., `fix/INT-123`)
2. PR title contains Linear issue ID (e.g., `[INT-123] Fix auth`)

Without both conditions, the PR won't appear in Linear's attachments array.

## State Descriptions

**Note:** "QA" is a custom state configured for this project. Standard Linear installations use only: Backlog, Todo, In Progress, In Review, Done.

| State       | Description                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Backlog     | New issues, not yet prioritized            |
| Todo        | Prioritized, ready to work on              |
| In Progress | Actively being worked on, branch created   |
| In Review   | PR created, awaiting code review           |
| QA          | PR approved, awaiting testing/verification |
| Done        | Complete, issue closed                     |

## Automated Transitions

The skill automatically handles these transitions:

1. **Start Work**: When `/linear INT-123` is called
   - Set state to "In Progress"
   - Must happen BEFORE any investigation

2. **Create PR**: When `gh pr create` succeeds
   - Set state to "In Review"
   - Verify PR appears in attachments

3. **Review Changes**: When PR receives change requests
   - Set state back to "In Progress"

## Manual Transitions

These require explicit user instruction:

1. **Done**: Only when user explicitly says "move to Done" or "mark as complete"
2. **Backlog → Todo**: Requires prioritization decision

## Authority Boundaries

### Agent Authority (Claude CAN do)

- ✅ Backlog → In Progress (when starting work)
- ✅ In Progress → In Review (when PR created)
- ✅ In Review → QA (when PR approved)

### User-Only Authority (Claude CANNOT do)

- 🛑 ANY → Done (terminal state, user-controlled)
- 🛑 Done → ANY (reopening is user-controlled)
- 🛑 Batch state updates (must be one-at-a-time with verification)

**CRITICAL:** Agent stops at QA. Never mark issues as Done.

### Enforcement Rules

| Scenario                   | Agent Response                                        |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Single issue completed     | Move to In Review or QA, STOP, report to user         |
| Multiple issues to process | Complete ONE, checkpoint, wait for user instruction   |
| User says "mark as Done"   | Then and only then move to Done                       |
| Temptation to batch update | STOP — each issue requires separate verification gate |

## Parent Execution Flow

When `/linear INT-XXX` is called on a **parent issue with child subissues**, the workflow changes significantly:

```
PARENT ISSUE:
                    +-------------------------+
                    |        Backlog          |
                    +-----------+-------------+
                                |
                    /linear INT-<parent> called
                    (children detected)
                                |
                                v
                    +-------------------------+
                    |      In Progress        |  ← Parent stays here during all child work
                    +-----------+-------------+
                                |
                    All children complete +
                    PR created
                                |
                                v
                    +-------------------------+
                    |       In Review         |
                    +-------------------------+


CHILD ISSUES (executed continuously, no stops):

### Parent Execution State Rules

| Event                        | Issue  | From        | To          |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| Start parent execution       | Parent | Backlog     | In Progress |
| Begin child work             | Child  | Backlog     | In Progress |
| Complete child (CI + commit) | Child  | In Progress | In Review   |
| ALL children done, PR up     | Parent | In Progress | In Review   |

### Key Differences from Single-Issue Flow

| Aspect        | Single Issue                      | Parent Execution                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Checkpoints   | STOP after each issue             | NO stops between children            |
| Branch        | One branch per issue              | One branch for parent (all children) |
| PR            | One PR per issue                  | One PR for parent                    |
| State updates | Sequential with user confirmation | Continuous, automatic                |
