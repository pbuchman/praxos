> **IntexuraOS is a personal agentic operating system for turning thoughts into executed work.**
>
> Send a WhatsApp message, dashboard task, GitHub comment, link, or research question. IntexuraOS routes it to a specialist agent, performs the work through typed service boundaries, verifies the result, and notifies you when there is something to review.
>
> A thought becomes a note. A date becomes a calendar event. A link becomes an enriched bookmark. A question becomes a multi-model research report. A bug report becomes a planned, tested code change running on your own machine.

## Why It Is Different

IntexuraOS is not one general assistant with a long tool list. It is a set of narrow agents, each with one domain, wrapped in deterministic software that controls what the model is allowed to do.

| What it is not                 | What IntexuraOS does instead                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Not one generic chatbot**    | Specialist agents own notes, calendar, research, bookmarks, writing, RAG, notifications, Linear, GitHub, and code execution.                                   |
| **Not just tool calling**      | Tool access is typed, gated, audited, and service-owned; unsupported requests fail clearly instead of being forced through a fallback workflow.                |
| **Not just RAG**               | Retrieval is domain-specific, citation-validated, and connected to user knowledge plus recent WhatsApp/mobile context.                                         |
| **Not just autonomous coding** | Code runs locally on your worker machine, inside isolated containers, with design review, independent verification, retry, and PR delivery.                    |
| **Not prompt glue**            | Prompts are semver-versioned, LLM usage is attributed by prompt type, malformed model outputs are repaired or stored for review, and service state is durable. |

The result is closer to a personal operating system than a productivity app: a single front door into many safe, inspectable workflows.

## Agentic Patterns In Production

| Pattern                     | IntexuraOS implementation                                                                                              | What it proves                                                                                           |

## Direct-Tool Intelligence

You submit tasks while walking, commuting, or thinking of something else. WhatsApp is the mobile interface because it is already on your phone and already open. IntexuraOS turns that text into structured work.

| You say                                            | What happens                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _"Fix the Safari login redirect"_                  | After confirmation, a code task starts in planning mode for design review.            |
| _"Research quantum computing with Claude and GPT"_ | After confirmation, a research draft is created for review.                           |
| _"Schedule a sync with engineering Tuesday at 2"_  | Event details are clarified and shown for confirmation before creation.               |
| _"Save a note about the Q4 report"_                | After confirmation, a note is saved with a generated title and searchable metadata.   |
| _"Save this link about TypeScript 5.0"_            | After confirmation, the bookmark is saved, enriched, and summarized through WhatsApp. |

Direct tools cover notes, calendar queries and updates, research drafts, bookmarks, code tasks, configured external saving, and personal preferences. Read-only calendar and preference queries can return immediately; changes require confirmation. Unsupported requests get a clear response.

## Flagship Subsystem: Self-Building Code

Most AI coding tools assume you are sitting at a keyboard. IntexuraOS does not.

You describe the change through WhatsApp, the dashboard, Linear, or GitHub. The code agent designs the approach, pauses for review when needed, dispatches execution to a local worker, runs tests, creates a pull request, updates Linear, and reports progress back through the dashboard and WhatsApp.

Your source code stays on infrastructure you control. The orchestrator runs on your worker machine and creates a separate isolated container for each task. Each task gets its own checkout, credentials, logs, and lifecycle state.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    START[Task submitted] --> PLAN[Planning agent writes design]
    PLAN --> REVIEW{Design approved?}
    REVIEW -->|yes| EXEC[Execution agent writes code]
    REVIEW -->|changes requested| PLAN
    EXEC --> TEST[Run tests and checks]
    TEST --> VERIFY[Independent completion verifier]
    VERIFY -->|passed| PR[Pull request ready]
    VERIFY -->|failed| RETRY[Retry with preserved context]
    RETRY --> EXEC
    PR --> LINEAR[Linear updated]
    PR --> WA[WhatsApp notification]
```

### Code Execution Guarantees

- **Local worker execution**: the coding agent runs on your machine under your AI subscription.
- **Container isolation**: each task has its own checkout, credentials, and restricted runtime.
- **Design review**: code tasks default to planning before implementation.
- **Independent verification**: the worker does not approve its own work.
- **Retry and remediation**: failed completion checks preserve context and resume rather than dropping work.
- **GitHub feedback loop**: PR comments can create follow-up tasks with full branch context.

## Multi-Model Research Council

Research-agent does not ask one model and trust the answer. It sends the same structured research plan to selected models through OpenRouter, stores each result independently, then synthesizes the reports with attribution.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Q[Research prompt and context] --> DRAFT[Reviewable research draft]
    DRAFT --> FANOUT[Parallel models via OpenRouter]
    FANOUT --> GEM[Gemini]
    FANOUT --> GPT[GPT]
    FANOUT --> CLAUDE[Claude]
    FANOUT --> SONAR[Perplexity Sonar]
    GEM --> SYN[Synthesis]
    GPT --> SYN
    CLAUDE --> SYN
    SONAR --> SYN
    SYN --> ATTR[Attribution validation]
    ATTR -->|valid| SHARE[Shareable report]
    ATTR -->|invalid| REPAIR[Attribution repair]
    REPAIR --> SHARE
    SHARE --> NOTION[Notion export]
    SHARE --> WA2[WhatsApp delivery]
```

The output is not a blended paragraph. It is a report that keeps source reports available, names which models supported which claims, and surfaces disagreements rather than hiding them.

## Grounded RAG And Memory

The fishing assistant and digest pipelines show the same philosophy in smaller domains: retrieve evidence, structure it, validate output, and keep state inspectable.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    KB[Knowledge pages] --> CHUNK[Chunk and embed]
    DIGEST[WhatsApp digests] --> EVIDENCE[Evidence pool]
    RAW[Recent raw messages] --> EVIDENCE
    CHUNK --> RETRIEVE[Retrieve and rank]
    EVIDENCE --> RETRIEVE
    RETRIEVE --> PROMPT[Answer prompt with source aliases]
    PROMPT --> JSON[Strict JSON answer]
    JSON --> CITE[Citation validation]
    CITE -->|valid| ANSWER[Stored answer]
    CITE -->|invalid| REPAIR2[Repair prompt]
    REPAIR2 --> CITE
```

## Engineering Proof

The system can only delegate work safely because the engineering discipline is strict.

| Discipline                 | How it is enforced                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **95% coverage gate**      | CI enforces at least 95% line, branch, function, and statement coverage.                                           |
| **Strict TypeScript**      | `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, exact optional properties, explicit booleans, and typed results.                       |
| **Prompt versioning**      | LLM prompts are `PromptBuilder` objects with semver versions and CI-enforced bump checks.                          |
| **Cross-LLM verification** | The writer and verifier are different providers for high-stakes code workflows.                                    |
| **Service ownership**      | Apps own their Firestore collections and communicate through typed internal HTTP clients.                          |
| **Infrastructure as code** | Terraform owns persistent infrastructure; no manual cloud console changes.                                         |
| **Usage visibility**       | LLM usage is tracked by model, provider, prompt type, call source, and correlation metadata.                       |
| **CI gates**               | Verification scripts cover package exports, boundaries, env wiring, prompt versions, logging, contracts, and more. |

## Getting Started

### For Users

You need three things: a WhatsApp account, a Google account, and a web browser.

1. **Sign up** through the [web app](https://intexuraos.cloud/) and connect your WhatsApp number with a one-time verification code.
2. **Link your Google account** for calendar access.
3. **Send your first text message** and the system routes it immediately.

The platform provides fallback OpenRouter access, so you can run research and generate bookmarks before configuring your own OpenRouter key. For coding tasks, connect a worker machine. For project tracking, connect Linear. For research exports, connect Notion. Each integration is optional and independent.

### For Developers

> **Note:** Full setup requires Google Cloud credentials and external service accounts such as Auth0, WhatsApp Business, Linear, and provider API keys.

```bash
# Prerequisites: Node.js 22+, pnpm 9+, Docker
pnpm install
cp .envrc.local.example .envrc.local
direnv allow
pnpm run dev
```

<summary><h2>Deliberate Scope Decisions</h2></summary>

IntexuraOS is designed for individual power users who want depth in one workflow over breadth across many.

- **WhatsApp-only mobile**: no SMS, email, or native push channel.
- **Google Calendar only**: Outlook and Apple Calendar are not connected.
- **Linear for project tracking**: Jira, Asana, and other trackers are not connected.
- **Android for notification capture**: iOS notification forwarding is not supported.
- **English and Polish natively**: other languages may work, but are not explicitly tested.
- **Designed for individual use**: no shared workspaces or team collaboration features.
- **No recurring calendar creation**: calendar event creation handles single instances; Message Digests and calendar lookahead have their own schedules.
- **Two worker machines**: one primary and one fallback coding worker.
- **Optional OpenRouter key**: your own key is validated before storage; platform access supplies a fallback.
- **Design review before code execution**: a deliberate quality gate, not an optimization to remove.
