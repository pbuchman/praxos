# 024 - Coverage Improvements

## Goal

Achieve and maintain 100% test coverage across the monorepo where practical.

## Current State

- **Statements**: 97.82%
- **Branches**: 95.18%
- **Functions**: 99.06%
- **Lines**: 97.86%

## Success Criteria

- Coverage thresholds met (95% minimum for all metrics)
- All tiers addressed or marked as intentionally uncovered
- CI passes (`npm run ci`)

## Scope

All files showing < 100% coverage in the coverage report.

## Approach

Work through coverage gaps by tier (quick fixes first, then larger efforts).
