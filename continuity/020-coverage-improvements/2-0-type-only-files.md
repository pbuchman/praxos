# Type-Only Files (0% Coverage - Expected)

## Status: BLOCKED (No Action Needed)

These files show 0% coverage but contain **only TypeScript type definitions** with no runtime code. They cannot be covered by tests because there's nothing to execute.

## Items

| # | File | Reason | Status |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | `packages/llm-audit/src/types.ts` | Pure type definitions | Blocked - No runtime code |
| 2 | `packages/llm-contract/src/types.ts` | Pure type definitions | Blocked - No runtime code |

## Notes

These files export only:
- `interface` declarations
- `type` aliases
- No functions, classes, or executable code

Coverage tools report 0% because there are no statements to execute. This is expected and correct behavior - no action needed.
