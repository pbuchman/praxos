## Review Checklist

- Terraform foundation: INT-1633 resources use `terraform/hetzner-prod` and do
  not create a second GCP environment root.
- Runtime and edge: INT-1634 PM2 ports, nginx routes, secrets, certbot, and
  Google OIDC verification match the current service inventory.
- Async control plane: INT-1635 retains GCP topics/functions and stages
  Hetzner-targeted Pub/Sub and Scheduler consumers behind
  `activate_hetzner_async_consumers`.
- Web and integrations: INT-1636 keeps public API paths generated from
  `apps/web/service-manifest.json`, retains GCS bucket routes, and records
  external callback changes.
- Deployment and rollback: INT-1637 has a no-cutover PR gate, replacement PR
  workflow, rollback steps, and this resource disposition review.
