# Intex Agent Production Matrix Corpus Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. The primary agent performs implementation; subagents are used only for final review. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Make the canonical 20-scenario Matrix/WhatsApp corpus run entirely against the Hetzner production IntexuraOS runtime and iterate through deployment and live verification until it passes or exposes a concrete external blocker.

**Architecture:** The evaluator and Matrix credentials remain on Home Dev. Google-OIDC-protected, corpus-only Nginx routes connect that runner to production WhatsApp Service and Intex Agent control planes; Meta webhooks, sessions, DeepSeek calls, strict tool mocks, and Test Runs execute on Hetzner with runtime audience `hetzner-prod`.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Fastify, Zod, Firestore, PM2, Nginx/OpenResty Lua, Google OIDC, GCP Secret Manager/Terraform, Vitest, Bash, Matrix, WhatsApp Cloud API, OpenRouter DeepSeek V4 Flash and MiniMax M3.

## Global Constraints

- Runner host is `home-dev`; system-under-test environment is `prod`; runtime audience and trusted runtime are `hetzner-prod`.
- Agent model is exactly `or:deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`; semantic evaluator is exactly `or:minimax/minimax-m3`.
- A complete pass contains 20 scenarios, 59 turns/replies, 17 confirmation decisions, 19 strict-mock tool executions, and 20 distinct sessions.
- Production product-tool executor admission must remain zero; any missing mock evidence fails closed.
- No operator identity, phone, Matrix identifier/token, capability, HMAC/signing/encryption key, prompt, reply, or raw tool arguments enter Git or safe reports.
- The Home Dev Matrix token and targets remain on Home Dev.
- `pnpm run ci:tracked` runs once before commit and is repeated only when its own failure requires an integrated recheck.
- Each live command performs at most one corpus run; ambiguous delivery is reconciled and never blindly resent.
- After each completed plan task, send the operator `Krok N/15 wykonany — <wynik>; kolejny: <opis>` through the established Matrix/WhatsApp-visible channel when that channel is available; never label a partial task complete.

---

### Task 1: Introduce the closed production runtime-audience contract

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/http-contracts/src/matrixCorpus.ts`
- Modify: `packages/http-contracts/src/index.ts`
- Test: `packages/http-contracts/src/__tests__/matrixCorpus.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces `MATRIX_CORPUS_PRODUCTION_RUNTIME_AUDIENCE`, `MatrixCorpusRuntimeAudience`, and `matrixCorpusRuntimeAudienceSchema` with closed values `home-dev | hetzner-prod`.
- Production creation/execution code consumes the production constant; legacy decoding may consume the union schema.

- [ ] Add failing contract tests for accepting `hetzner-prod`, decoding legacy `home-dev`, and rejecting arbitrary strings.
- [ ] Run `pnpm --filter @intexuraos/http-contracts test -- matrixCorpus` and confirm the new production assertion fails.
- [ ] Add the constants/type/schema and export them without changing unrelated HTTP contracts.
- [ ] Re-run the targeted contract tests and typecheck until they pass.

### Task 2: Enable production WhatsApp corpus configuration safely

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/whatsapp-service/src/config.ts`
- Test: `apps/whatsapp-service/src/__tests__/config.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes the shared production audience constant.
- Produces `WhatsAppMatrixCorpusConfig` that enables only `(dev, home-dev, home-dev)` or `(prod, hetzner-prod, hetzner-prod)` and otherwise fails startup.

- [ ] Add failing tests for the valid production tuple and invalid mixed environment/runtime tuples.
- [ ] Run the config test file and verify the production case fails under the current Home-Dev-only parser.
- [ ] Implement exact tuple validation while preserving secret-shape validation and disabled behavior.
- [ ] Run the config tests and `pnpm --filter @intexuraos/whatsapp-service typecheck`.

### Task 3: Carry `hetzner-prod` through WhatsApp capability, ingress, and recovery

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/whatsapp-service/src/domain/matrixCorpus/types.ts`
- Modify: `apps/whatsapp-service/src/domain/matrixCorpus/{attestation.ts,controlAuthorization.ts}`
- Modify: `apps/whatsapp-service/src/domain/matrixCorpus/ports/{intexAgentMatrixCorpusClient.ts,matrixCorpusRouteControlPlane.ts,signedEnvelopeStore.ts}`
- Modify: `apps/whatsapp-service/src/infra/firestore/{matrixCorpusIngress.ts,matrixCorpusRecoveryScanner.ts,matrixCorpusRepository.ts}`

- Modify: `apps/whatsapp-service/src/services.ts`
- Test: corresponding files under `apps/whatsapp-service/src/__tests__/domain/matrixCorpus`, `infra`, `routes`, and `integration`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces records, signatures, route schemas, and downstream headers bound to the configured runtime audience rather than a literal.
- Legacy `home-dev` records remain readable/cleanable but are never admitted by a `hetzner-prod` runtime.

- [ ] Add/convert tests so the production fixture uses `hetzner-prod` and add an explicit legacy-audience non-execution test.
- [ ] Run only the affected WhatsApp Matrix-corpus tests and observe the literal-audience failures.
- [ ] Thread the configured production audience through issuance, consumption, outboxes, recovery, signed control, route control, and the Intex client.
- [ ] Re-run affected tests plus WhatsApp typecheck; verify replay/mismatch traffic still fails closed.

### Task 4: Enable production Intex Agent corpus configuration and strict-mock session types

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/intex-agent/src/config.ts`
- Modify: `apps/intex-agent/src/domain/matrixCorpus/{contextCrypto.ts,contextService.ts,matrixCorpusMessageHandler.ts}`
- Modify: `apps/intex-agent/src/domain/matrixCorpus/ports/{matrixCorpusContextRepository.ts,matrixCorpusManifestRepository.ts,testConfirmationRepository.ts}`
- Modify: `apps/intex-agent/src/domain/sessions/types.ts`
- Modify: `apps/intex-agent/src/infra/firestore/{matrixCorpusContextRepository.ts,matrixCorpusManifestRepository.ts,sessionRepository.ts,testConfirmationRepository.ts}`
- Test: corresponding Intex Agent config, domain, repository, route, services, and integration tests

**Interfaces:**
- Produces production-enabled config and immutable `hetzner-prod` test-session profiles.
- Strict executor resolution continues to depend only on accepted/decrypted server context.

- [ ] Add failing production config, context, confirmation-continuation, and legacy-audience rejection tests.
- [ ] Run the selected tests and verify they fail on current literals.
- [ ] Generalize types/schemas to the shared closed audience and pass the configured audience through composition.
- [ ] Run affected tests and Intex Agent typecheck; prove all 11 real tool clients remain uncalled in strict-mock tests.

### Task 5: Generalize Intex control routes, evidence, and Test Runs owner gate

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/intex-agent/src/routes/{matrixCorpusRoutes.ts,testRunRoutes.ts}`
- Modify: `apps/intex-agent/src/domain/testRuns/types.ts`
- Modify: `apps/intex-agent/src/infra/firestore/testRunRepository.ts`
- Modify: `apps/user-service/src/config.ts`
- Modify: `apps/user-service/src/routes/settingsRoutes.ts`
- Test: Intex route/Test Runs tests and User Service config/settings/OpenAPI tests

**Interfaces:**
- Produces owner-only production Test Runs under `hetzner-prod` and production availability metadata for the existing model-selector UX.
- The evaluator UID is read from protected configuration; no email or UID is tracked.

- [ ] Add failing tests for production owner access, non-owner denial, disabled behavior, and `hetzner-prod` settings metadata.
- [ ] Run targeted tests and confirm the old Home-Dev-only checks fail.
- [ ] Implement the production audience path without weakening exact-user authorization.
- [ ] Run targeted tests and typechecks for Intex Agent and User Service.

### Task 6: Add an OIDC-authenticated, prefixed evaluator HTTP transport

**Files:**

- Modify: `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- Modify: `packages/internal-clients/src/{intex-agent/types.ts,intex-agent/client.ts,whatsapp-service/types.ts,whatsapp-service/client.ts}`
- Test: `tools/intex-agent-evals/src/__tests__/productionControlTransport.test.ts`
- Test: internal-client tests for both services

**Interfaces:**
- Produces a Google identity-token provider for audience `https://intexuraos.cloud` and service prefixes `/internal/evals/whatsapp` and `/internal/evals/intex-agent`.
- Internal clients accept optional closed request-header/path adapters without changing default service-to-service behavior.

- [ ] Add failing tests for prefix construction, token caching/refresh, Authorization redaction, timeout, and token-provider failure.
- [ ] Add failing internal-client tests proving default URLs remain unchanged and evaluator prefixes are exact.
- [ ] Add direct `google-auth-library` dependency and minimal transport/client extension.
- [ ] Run evaluator transport tests, both internal-client suites, and their typechecks.

### Task 7: Expose only the corpus control plane through Hetzner Nginx

**Files:**
- Modify: `scripts/hetzner/nginx/intexuraos.conf`
- Modify: `scripts/hetzner/nginx/jwt-verify.lua`
- Test: `scripts/__tests__/hetzner-runtime.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces OIDC-protected rewrites from `/internal/evals/{whatsapp|intex-agent}/matrix-corpus/*` to each service's existing `/internal/matrix-corpus/*` routes.
- Assigns caller role `matrix_corpus_runner` only to the existing Home Dev `claude-code-dev` identity.

- [ ] Add failing static/runtime tests for exact route allowlisting, caller role, rewrite targets, header clearing, and non-corpus denial.
- [ ] Run the targeted Hetzner runtime tests and confirm failure.
- [ ] Implement the two exact locations and route-pattern authorization without altering broader internal routing.
- [ ] Run the tests and Nginx configuration validation fixture.

### Task 8: Declare and load production corpus secrets

**Files:**
- Modify: `terraform/environments/dev/main.tf`
- Modify: `scripts/hetzner/load-secrets.sh`
- Test: `scripts/__tests__/hetzner-runtime.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces ten Secret Manager containers and makes them available to the existing protected Hetzner environment loader.
- Does not place secret values in Terraform, shell defaults, tests, or Git.

- [ ] Add failing tests for the exact ten-name inventory, loader coverage, and absence of literal values.
- [ ] Run the targeted tests and confirm the inventory fails.
- [ ] Add secret descriptions, Hetzner runtime inventory, and loader names; remove the obsolete Home-Dev-only inventory comment.
- [ ] Run targeted tests and `terraform fmt -check` for the environment.

### Task 9: Wire production PM2 services and deployment readiness

**Files:**
- Modify: `ecosystem.config.prod.cjs`
- Modify: `scripts/hetzner/github-actions-deploy.sh`
- Test: `scripts/__tests__/ecosystem.prod.config.test.ts`
- Test: `scripts/__tests__/hetzner-runtime.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- WhatsApp receives bindings/HMAC/private signing key; Intex receives public signing/context keys; User Service receives owner UID and model/Test Runs flags.
- Fixed production flags are `enabled=true`, `trustedRuntime=hetzner-prod`, `runtimeAudience=hetzner-prod`.

- [ ] Replace forced-disable tests with failing exact per-service enablement/secret-isolation tests.
- [ ] Add failing deployment readiness checks for production corpus endpoints without issuing a run.
- [ ] Implement PM2 mappings and post-restart readiness verification.
- [ ] Run production ecosystem and Hetzner deployment tests.

**Files:**
- Modify: `tools/intex-agent-evals/src/matrixCorpus/liveRuntime.ts`
- Modify: `tools/intex-agent-evals/src/matrixCorpus/preflight.ts`
- Modify: `tools/intex-agent-evals/src/preflight.ts`
- Test: `tools/intex-agent-evals/src/__tests__/{matrixCorpusLiveRuntime.test.ts,matrixCorpusPreflight.test.ts}`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces a snapshot with `runnerHost=home-dev`, `environmentAlias=prod`, `runtimeAudience=hetzner-prod`, and a production deployment SHA equal to the requested SHA.
- Production readiness endpoints replace local signing/context-secret inspection; Matrix protected files remain local checks.

- [ ] Add failing tests for exact production attestation, OIDC readiness, no local-service fallback, and zero-write preflight.
- [ ] Run the two test files and observe current local-port/dev assertions fail.
- [ ] Replace loopback SUT clients with production OIDC clients and read `https://intexuraos.cloud/deployment.json` under bounded schemas/timeouts.
- [ ] Run targeted tests and evaluator typecheck.

### Task 11: Bind execution, reports, and retention to `hetzner-prod`

**Files:**
- Modify: `tools/intex-agent-evals/src/matrixCorpus/{liveExecution.ts,reportSchema.ts,retentionExecution.ts}`
- Modify: `tools/intex-agent-evals/src/reportWriter.ts`
- Modify: `packages/internal-clients/src/intex-agent/{types.ts,client.ts}`
- Test: evaluator control-plane, report, retention, runner, and composition tests

**Interfaces:**
- Produces only production-audience context registration, projections, evidence queries, cleanup digests, and safe reports.
- Reports retain `runnerHost=home-dev` separately from `environmentAlias=prod`.

- [ ] Add failing report/cardinality and legacy-retention isolation tests.
- [ ] Run the selected evaluator suites and verify literal `home-dev` failures.
- [ ] Thread the production audience through the execution state and clients; keep legacy cleanup audience-explicit.
- [ ] Run all evaluator Matrix-corpus tests and typecheck.

### Task 12: Replace the unsafe live command with the production command

**Files:**
- Create: `scripts/run-intex-agent-evals-prod.sh`
- Modify: `scripts/run-intex-agent-evals-home-dev.sh`
- Modify: `package.json`
- Test: `scripts/__tests__/run-intex-agent-evals-prod.test.ts`
- Modify/Test: `scripts/__tests__/run-intex-agent-evals-home-dev.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces canonical command `scripts/run-intex-agent-evals-prod.sh matrix-corpus` and package alias `eval:intex-agent:matrix-corpus`.
- Legacy Home Dev `matrix-corpus` exits `2` with `PRODUCTION_MATRIX_CORPUS_REQUIRED` before SSH/send.

- [ ] Add failing wrapper tests for argument framing, revision proof, safe output, signals, production target, and legacy rejection.
- [ ] Run both wrapper test files and confirm failure.
- [ ] Implement the production wrapper and remove live corpus dispatch from the legacy wrapper while preserving non-corpus diagnostics.
- [ ] Run both wrapper suites until they pass.

### Task 13: Update operator runbooks and perform three-axis review

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/testing/intex-agent-evals.md`
- Modify: `docs/testing/intex-agent-matrix-whatsapp-live-procedure.md`
- Modify: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-19-intex-agent-matrix-corpus-live-acceptance-design.md`
- Test: `tools/intex-agent-evals/src/__tests__/documentation.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces one unambiguous meaning for “odpal testy”: the production wrapper exactly once.
- Records deferred dedicated-account/portable-runner hardening without implementing it now.

- [ ] Update the documentation test first with the production command, Hetzner boundary, exact cardinalities, and legacy prohibition.
- [ ] Update the runbooks/spec annotations and run the documentation test.
- [ ] Dispatch three read-only subagent reviews: security/correctness, test completeness, and operator/Test Runs UX.
- [ ] Resolve every actionable review finding locally and rerun its targeted tests.

### Task 14: Verify, commit, push, and open the pull request

**Files:** all files changed by Tasks 1–13.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces a reviewed branch and ready pull request with no secret material.

- [ ] Run focused suites for HTTP contracts, WhatsApp, Intex Agent, User Service, evaluator, wrappers, Nginx/Hetzner, and production ecosystem.
- [ ] Scan tracked diff for credentials, operator PII, capability values, private paths, placeholders, debug output, and unrelated changes.
- [ ] Run `pnpm run ci:tracked` once; fix failures with targeted tests and repeat the full gate only if the integrated fix requires it.
- [ ] Use the project `commit-push` procedure to commit, push `codex/matrix-whatsapp-live-procedure`, open a ready PR, wait for checks, address failures, and merge to `development`.

### Task 15: Provision, deploy, run 20 scenarios, and close the loop

**Files/state:** GCP Secret Manager/Terraform state, GitHub deployment, Hetzner PM2/Nginx, Home Dev runner checkout, production Test Runs, Home Dev private artifacts.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces a deployed production revision and final PASS/FAIL evidence.

- [ ] Before merge/deploy enablement, inspect the Terraform plan; apply only the ten secret containers and required access when no unrelated mutation is present, then stream validated Home Dev values directly into secret versions without printing them.
- [ ] After merge, wait for the Hetzner deployment workflow and require public `deployment.json` to equal the merge SHA; verify public health and protected corpus readiness.
- [ ] Fast-forward the clean Home Dev runner checkout to that SHA without restarting Home Dev product services, then invoke `scripts/run-intex-agent-evals-prod.sh matrix-corpus` exactly once.
- [ ] Validate the report for 20/59/17/19 cardinalities, 20 distinct sessions, all deterministic/MiniMax verdicts, and zero real executor admissions; verify the same run in the authenticated production Test Runs browser view.
- [ ] For behavioral failures, always finish the executable corpus through scenario 020, preserve the complete failure inventory, and fix all collected behavioral boundaries in one reviewed revision before redeploying and repeating this task. Infrastructure or safety failures remain immediate fail-closed stops. Stop the overall loop only for a concrete external intervention that cannot be performed with available access.
