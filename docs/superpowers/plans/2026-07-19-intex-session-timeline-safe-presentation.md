# Intex Session Timeline Safe Presentation Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Prevent the authenticated Intex Agent session timeline from rendering arbitrary technical event payloads while preserving safe human-readable event evidence.

**Architecture:** Keep the API and stored events unchanged. `IntexSessionTimeline` applies an event-type allow-list plus closed canonical value sets, rejects structured object/array JSON in message strings, safely titles tool events, and omits the body paragraph when no safe value exists.

**Tech Stack:** React 19, TypeScript 5.8, Vitest 4, Testing Library, Home Dev, Chrome.

## Global Constraints

- Never render or log an entire event payload.
- Never display a `text` or `message` value that parses to a JSON object or array.
- Never format an enum-like payload string until it belongs to its canonical closed set.
- Preserve event title, icon, timestamp, order, session metadata, API/storage contracts, responsive layout, search, refresh, endpoint evaluations, MiniMax M3, and Matrix ordering.
- Keep the five user-owned untracked design files untouched and outside every commit.

### Task 1: Add the safe timeline body projection

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/intex-agent/IntexSessionTimeline.tsx`
- Test: `apps/web/src/components/intex-agent/__tests__/IntexSessionTimeline.test.tsx`
- Modify: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-18-intex-agent-live-acceptance-fixes.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `IntexAgentSessionEvent` with `type` and `payload`.
- Produces: internal `getEventBody(event): string | undefined`; `undefined` means render no body paragraph.

- [x] **Step 1: Add RED component regressions**

  Add an `event(overrides)` fixture and tests with exact assertions:

  ```tsx
  function event(overrides: Partial<IntexAgentSessionEvent> = {}): IntexAgentSessionEvent {
    return {
      id: 'event-1',
      sessionId: 'session-1',
      userId: 'user-1',
      type: 'user_message',
      payload: { text: 'Visible user text' },
      createdAt: '2026-06-24T22:15:01.000Z',
      ...overrides,
    };
  }
  ```

  Cover all twelve event types. Prove ordinary text, compatible `message`/`text`
  fallback priority, syntactically invalid text, and JSON primitives remain visible;
  serialized object and array strings are absent; `confirmation_resolved` accepts only
  `accepted`, `rejected`, and `superseded`; a resolution-less confirmation card has no
  `<p>`; all tool event variants accept only canonical tool names and ignore extra
  `result`/`metadata`; lifecycle and fallback values use closed sets; unknown values and
  unsupported technical payloads remain absent.

- [x] **Step 2: Run the focused test and observe RED**

  Run:

  ```bash
  pnpm --filter @intexuraos/web exec vitest run src/components/intex-agent/__tests__/IntexSessionTimeline.test.tsx
  ```

  Expected: new privacy assertions fail because structured message JSON or the generic
  `JSON.stringify(event.payload)` output is still present.

- [x] **Step 3: Implement the minimal allow-list**

  Add a helper that trims message strings and rejects parsed objects/arrays:

  ```ts
  function getDisplayString(payload: Record<string, unknown>, key: string): string | undefined {
    const value = payload[key];
    if (typeof value !== 'string' || value.trim() === '') return undefined;
    const trimmed = value.trim();
    try {
      const parsed: unknown = JSON.parse(trimmed);
      if (typeof parsed === 'object' && parsed !== null) return undefined;
    } catch {
      // Ordinary text is intentionally displayable.
    }
    return value;
  }
  ```

  Define readonly canonical sets for existing session statuses, start reasons, end
  reasons, Intex Agent tool names, fallback reasons, and confirmation resolutions.
  Switch on `event.type` to select only the fields defined in the design. The title and
  body of tool events must share the same canonical tool resolver; an unknown name uses
  `Tool call started`, `Tool call completed`, or `Tool call failed` and no body. Return
  `undefined` for all unknown body data. Compute the body once per event and render
  `<p>` only when it is defined. Do not introduce a redaction walker or backend change.

- [x] **Step 4: Run focused GREEN and package checks**

  Run:

  ```bash
  pnpm --filter @intexuraos/web exec vitest run src/components/intex-agent/__tests__/IntexSessionTimeline.test.tsx
  pnpm --filter @intexuraos/web typecheck
  pnpm --filter @intexuraos/web lint
  ```

  Expected: all commands exit `0`.

- [x] **Step 5: Review, verify, and record implementation evidence**

  Request independent spec and code-quality reviews, resolve every Critical/Important
  finding, run `git diff --check`, then run exact `pnpm run ci:tracked`. Mark only the
  completed Task 31 implementation/review checkboxes in the active plan.

### Task 2: Ship and repeat the live acceptance audit

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-18-intex-agent-live-acceptance-fixes.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: merged `development` revision containing Task 1.
- Produces: exact Home Dev deployment evidence and privacy-safe Chrome acceptance evidence.

- [x] **Step 1: Ship through the repository workflow**

  Commit only the intended design, plan, component, test, and active-plan files. Push a
  `codex/` branch, create a reviewed PR to `development`, require every GitHub check to
  pass, merge it, and verify Home Dev runs the exact merge SHA.

- [x] **Step 2: Repeat the logged-in Chrome audit**

  On desktop and a narrow mobile breakpoint, verify session loading, rapid selection,
  focus restoration, refresh, timeline/rail ordering, and no horizontal overflow.
  Inspect only privacy-safe shapes: require zero body strings that parse to objects or
  arrays, zero displayed technical key names from the observed regression, generic safe
  titles for noncanonical tool names, zero console warnings/errors, and only successful
  session list/event responses.

  **Live evidence:** PR [#2346](https://github.com/pbuchman/intexuraos/pull/2346)
  merged as `aef9a446ddd2977fe447ca5f0f4eeff1445d2058`; Home Dev served that exact
  frontend revision. The focused suite passed `39/39`, exact tracked CI passed
  `5556/5556`, and independent review found no Critical, Important, or Minor issues.
  The logged-in desktop/mobile audit found zero structured JSON bodies, zero displayed
  regression key names, zero unsafe tool titles, no horizontal overflow, correct
  responsive ordering and focus restoration, consistent rapid selection, one successful
  list plus one successful event response on refresh, no network failures, and no console
  warnings/errors.

- [x] **Step 3: Record final evidence and close the loop**

  Update Task 30 and Task 31 checkboxes/evidence without private content. Run the exact
  commit gate again for the documentation-only evidence commit, ship it through a final
  reviewed PR, and audit the complete user goal requirement by requirement.

  **Closeout evidence:** PR [#2347](https://github.com/pbuchman/intexuraos/pull/2347)
  merged as `7210fb225133ef2e13bd6c92e386abc883e4059c` after all 15 non-skipped
  GitHub checks passed, including all eight required status checks. Its exact
  documentation diff passed local
  `pnpm run ci:tracked` with `5556/5556` tests, coverage, build, format, and bundle
  budget; independent review reported zero Critical, Important, or Minor findings.
  The committed evidence contains no private message content, identifiers, tool
  arguments, or user-specific account data.
