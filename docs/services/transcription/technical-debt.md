## Future Plans

- **Add alternative transcription providers:** The provider factory pattern is in place but only Speechmatics is implemented. Adding providers like Google Speech-to-Text or OpenAI Whisper would enable provider fallback and cost optimization.
- **Streaming transcription support:** The current batch-only architecture means results are delayed by polling. Real-time streaming would reduce latency for short messages.
- **Provider-specific vocabulary management:** The custom vocabulary is currently hardcoded. Moving it to configuration or user-service settings would allow per-user or per-language vocabulary customization.

## Code Smells

No code smells identified.

## Test Coverage Gaps

No gaps identified. The worker has comprehensive test coverage across all modules:

| Test File                      | Coverage Area                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `main.test.ts`                 | Full orchestration pipeline including all error paths  |
| `polling.test.ts`              | Done, rejected, timeout, and transient error scenarios |
| `format-error.test.ts`         | All error pattern branches                             |
| `types.test.ts`                | Config loader validation                               |
| `provider-factory.test.ts`     | Known and unknown provider routing                     |
| `speechmatics-adapter.test.ts` | Submit, poll, and transcript fetch operations          |

---

## TypeScript Issues

No `any` types, `@ts-ignore`, or `@ts-expect-error` directives found in the codebase.

---

## TODOs / FIXMEs

No TODO, FIXME, or HACK comments found in the codebase.

---

## SRP Violations

No files exceed 300 lines of business logic. The largest file (`adapter.ts`) includes substantial JSDoc comments, type definitions, and three method implementations, which is appropriate for a single adapter class.

---

## Code Duplicates

No significant code duplication identified. Error handling follows a consistent pattern but each case handles different error shapes appropriately.

---

## v8 Ignore Annotations

| File         | Category      | Lines   | Reason                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.ts`   | `module-init` | 71–79   | Config, storage, publisher initialized at cold start          |
| `logger.ts`  | `module-init` | 25–33   | Logger initialized at module load                             |

All annotations use valid categories from the project's coverage exemption rules.

---

## Release Reliability Improvements

Since v3.8.0, handler tests cover video-event validation, the orchestration suite verifies private-source/media-kind preservation on success and failure, and publisher tests cover those fields. Expected provider rejection and polling warnings are suppressed from error reporting while remaining in logs. Speechmatics remains the sole implemented provider.

## Resolved Issues

| Date       | Issue                                                        | Resolution                                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2026-03-09 | v8 ignore blocks in `adapter.ts` for error extraction utils  | Replaced with real test coverage (`5a4f7131`, `1d89a24a`) |
