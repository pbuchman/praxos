## Summary

| Category    | Count | Severity |
| ----------- | ----- | -------- |
| Code Smells | 0     | ---      |
| Test Gaps   | 0     | ---      |
| Type Issues | 0     | ---      |
| TODOs       | 0     | ---      |
| **Total**   | **0** | ---      |

This service was introduced in v3.4.0, extended with categorized writing configuration in v3.5.0, and migrated to per-user LLM client resolution in v3.6.0. It has no accumulated technical debt. No `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `any` type, `@ts-ignore`, or `@ts-expect-error` directives exist in the source code.

---

## Future Plans

- No TODO, FIXME, or HACK comments exist in the codebase
- Potential areas for future development based on current architecture:
  - Export drafts to other formats (PDF, DOCX) beyond markdown
  - Collaborative editing — allowing multiple users to impose on a shared buffer
  - Buffer archiving and deletion endpoints
  - Webhook/Pub/Sub integration for notifying other services when drafts are generated
  - Streaming draft generation for real-time feedback in the web UI
  - Additional writing categories beyond threads, linkedin, and general

## Code Smells

### High Priority

None identified.

### Medium Priority

None identified.

### Low Priority

None identified.

---

## Test Coverage Gaps

No gaps identified. The service has comprehensive test coverage across:

- Domain services (`applyIntentToState.test.ts`, `sanitize.test.ts`)
- Use cases (`imposeOnBuffer.test.ts`, `usecases.test.ts`, `writingConfigUsecases.test.ts`)
- Routes (`hellscriptRoutes.test.ts`, `writingConfigRoutes.test.ts`)
- Infrastructure (`firestoreHellscriptRepository.test.ts`, `firestoreWritingConfigRepository.test.ts`, `llmDraftGenerator.test.ts`, `llmIntentInterpreter.test.ts`)
- Prompts (`prompts.test.ts`)
- Configuration (`config.test.ts`, `server.test.ts`, `services.test.ts`)

---

## TypeScript Issues

None identified. No `any` types, `@ts-ignore`, or `@ts-expect-error` directives in the source code.

---

## TODOs / FIXMEs

None found.

---

## SRP Violations

None identified. The largest route file (`writingConfigRoutes.ts`) handles seven endpoints with logic delegated to use cases.

---

## Code Duplicates

None identified.

---

## Deprecations

The direct `infra-gemini` dependency and platform Gemini fallback were removed after v3.8.0. The active adapters are `LlmIntentInterpreter` and `LlmDraftGenerator`; deployments require the OpenRouter platform credential.

## Resolved Issues

| Date       | Issue                                               | Resolution                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2026-04-14 | Startup-scoped GeminiClient shared across all users | Replaced with per-user `LlmGenerateClient` via `UserServiceClient.getLlmClient()` (INT-1369)                         |
| 2026-04-16 | Centralized LLM pricing logic in service            | Removed — pricing handled by `llm-usage-service` via `HttpInternalAuthUsageSink` (INT-1387)                          |
| 2026-03-22 | String-based error matching in repository layer     | Replaced with typed errors (`BufferNotFoundError`, `DraftGenerationError`, `SampleNotFoundError`, `MaxSamplesError`) |
| 2026-03-22 | Phantom timeline entries on `category_required`     | Deferred event save until category is resolved                                                                       |
| 2026-03-22 | Sequential Firestore reads during draft generation  | Parallelized config, samples, and prior draft reads                                                                  |
