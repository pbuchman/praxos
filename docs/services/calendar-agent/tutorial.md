# Calendar Agent — Tutorial

Learn to manage Google Calendar events through IntexuraOS with preview support.

## Prerequisites

- Auth0 access token
- Google account connected via user-service
- Familiarity with ISO 8601 datetime formats

## Daily Lookahead And Confirmed WhatsApp Updates

For the current WhatsApp flow, send a text request to Intex, resolve any missing details, and use its confirmation buttons before changes execute. For an update, identify the event and requested change; Intex queries first and clarifies ambiguous matches. Review each event in a multiple-event confirmation because those operations execute independently.

To configure daily lookahead, call `PUT /schedules/calendar-daily-lookahead` with the user’s bearer token and a body such as:

```json
{ "enabled": true, "localTime": "08:00", "timeZone": "Europe/Warsaw" }
```

Inspect `GET /schedules/calendar-daily-lookahead` for delivery readiness and the next run. This needs the connected private WhatsApp/Matrix outbound path. The schedule starts a fresh Intex conversation requesting events in the next 24 hours. Set `enabled` to `false` to pause it.


## Part 1: Hello World — List Events

List your upcoming calendar events:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://calendar-agent.intexuraos.com/events?timeMin=2026-01-24T00:00:00Z&maxResults=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "events": [
      {
        "id": "event123",
        "summary": "Team Standup",
        "start": {
          "dateTime": "2026-01-24T10:00:00-05:00",
          "timeZone": "America/New_York"
        },
        "end": {
          "dateTime": "2026-01-24T10:30:00-05:00",
          "timeZone": "America/New_York"
        },
        "status": "confirmed",
        "htmlLink": "https://www.google.com/event?eid=event123"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Checkpoint:** You should see your upcoming events.

## Part 2: Create an Event

Create a new timed event:

```bash
curl -X POST https://calendar-agent.intexuraos.com/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "summary": "Product Review",
    "description": "Q1 product roadmap review",
    "location": "Conference Room A",
    "start": {
      "dateTime": "2026-01-27T14:00:00Z",
      "timeZone": "America/New_York"
    },
    "end": {
      "dateTime": "2026-01-27T15:00:00Z",
      "timeZone": "America/New_York"
    },
    "attendees": [
      {"email": "alice@example.com"},
      {"email": "bob@example.com", "optional": true}
    ]
  }'
```

**Response (201 Created):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "event": {
      "id": "newEvent123",
      "summary": "Product Review",
      "start": { "dateTime": "2026-01-27T14:00:00Z" },
      "end": { "dateTime": "2026-01-27T15:00:00Z" },
      "attendees": [
        { "email": "alice@example.com", "responseStatus": "needsAction" },
        { "email": "bob@example.com", "optional": true, "responseStatus": "needsAction" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**All-day event:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://calendar-agent.intexuraos.com/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "summary": "Company Holiday",
    "start": {"date": "2026-12-25"},
    "end": {"date": "2026-12-26"}
  }'
```

Note: All-day events use `date` (YYYY-MM-DD), not `dateTime`. End date is exclusive.

## Part 3: Using Preview Generation

The preview flow allows users to see what will be created before committing. Use the synchronous internal HTTP endpoint. Stored preview reads remain available, but retired asynchronous Pub/Sub preview topics are not part of the current flow.

### Step 3.1: Generate Preview Synchronously (Recommended)

For approval flows where the preview must be available immediately:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://calendar-agent.intexuraos.com/internal/calendar/preview" \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: YOUR_INTERNAL_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "actionId": "action-123",
    "userId": "user-456",
    "text": "Dentist appointment next Tuesday at 2pm",
    "currentDate": "2026-03-07"
  }'
```

**Response (ready):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "preview": {
      "actionId": "action-123",
      "userId": "user-456",
      "status": "ready",
      "summary": "Dentist appointment",
      "start": "2026-03-11T14:00:00",
      "end": "2026-03-11T15:00:00",
      "duration": "1 hour",
      "isAllDay": false,
      "reasoning": "Interpreted 'next Tuesday at 2pm' as March 11th based on current date.",
      "generatedAt": "2026-03-07T10:00:05Z"
    }
  }
}
```

The synchronous endpoint returns the preview data directly in the response, avoiding the need to poll.

### Step 3.2: Check Preview Status

For a preview created through a trusted internal caller, inspect its stored status:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://calendar-agent.intexuraos.com/internal/calendar/preview/action-123" \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: YOUR_INTERNAL_TOKEN"
```

**Response (pending):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "preview": {
      "actionId": "action-123",
      "userId": "user-456",
      "status": "pending",
      "generatedAt": "2026-01-24T10:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

**Response (ready):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "preview": {
      "actionId": "action-123",
      "userId": "user-456",
      "status": "ready",
      "summary": "Dentist appointment",
      "start": "2026-01-28T14:00:00",
      "end": "2026-01-28T15:00:00",
      "duration": "1 hour",
      "isAllDay": false,
      "reasoning": "Interpreted 'next Tuesday at 2pm' as January 28th based on current date.",
      "generatedAt": "2026-01-24T10:00:05Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3.3: Understanding Preview Fields

| Field       | Description                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `status`    | `pending` (processing), `ready`, or `failed`      |
| `duration`  | Human-readable like "1 hour 30 minutes"           |
| `isAllDay`  | True if event spans full days                     |
| `reasoning` | LLM's explanation of how it interpreted the input |

### Step 3.4: Process Action After Approval

When user approves, the preview data is used. Pass the full user prompt via the `text` field:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://calendar-agent.intexuraos.com/internal/calendar/process-action" \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: YOUR_INTERNAL_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": {
      "id": "action-123",
      "userId": "user-456",
      "title": "Dentist appointment"
    },
    "text": "Dentist appointment next Tuesday at 2pm"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "completed",
    "message": "Event \"Dentist appointment\" created successfully",
    "resourceUrl": "https://www.google.com/event?eid=abc123"
  }
}
```

If preview is ready, it skips LLM extraction and uses cached data. The `resourceUrl` links directly to the created Google Calendar event. If the event has no `htmlLink`, it falls back to `/#/calendar`.

The `text` field contains the full user prompt for LLM extraction. When omitted, falls back to `action.title`. Always prefer sending `text` with the complete natural language input.

## Part 4: Handle Errors

### Error: Not Connected

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "Google account not connected. Please connect your account in settings."
  }
}
```

**Solution:** User must connect Google account via user-service OAuth flow.

### Error: Token Expired

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
    "message": "OAuth token expired"
  }
}
```

**Solution:** user-service handles token refresh. This error means refresh failed.

### Error: Preview Not Found

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "preview": null
  }
}
```

**Solution:** Preview may not exist yet. Poll until it appears and status changes, or timeout.

### Error: Preview Failed

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "preview": {
      "actionId": "action-123",
      "status": "failed",
      "error": "Could not extract date from 'sometime next week'. Please specify a date.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'sometime next week' is too vague for scheduling."
    }
  }
}
```

**Solution:** Check the error and reasoning fields. The failed event is saved for manual review.

## Part 5: Check Availability

Find free time slots across multiple calendars:

```bash
curl -X POST https://calendar-agent.intexuraos.com/freebusy \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "timeMin": "2026-01-27T00:00:00Z",
    "timeMax": "2026-01-27T23:59:59Z",
    "items": [
      {"id": "primary"},
      {"id": "alice@example.com"},
      {"id": "bob@example.com"}
    ]
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "calendars": {
      "primary": {
        "busy": [{ "start": "2026-01-27T10:00:00Z", "end": "2026-01-27T11:00:00Z" }]
      },
      "alice@example.com": {
        "busy": [
          { "start": "2026-01-27T09:00:00Z", "end": "2026-01-27T12:00:00Z" },
          { "start": "2026-01-27T14:00:00Z", "end": "2026-01-27T17:00:00Z" }
        ]
      },
      "bob@example.com": {
        "busy": []
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Finding free slots:** Subtract busy slots from the time range.

## Part 6: Update and Delete

**Update event:**

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://calendar-agent.intexuraos.com/events/event123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "summary": "Updated Title",
    "start": {"dateTime": "2026-01-27T15:00:00Z"}
  }'
```

Only provided fields are updated. Other fields remain unchanged.

**Delete event:**

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://calendar-agent.intexuraos.com/events/event123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Part 7: Review Failed Events

List events that failed extraction:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://calendar-agent.intexuraos.com/failed-events?limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "failedEvents": [
      {
        "id": "failed-001",
        "actionId": "action-789",
        "originalText": "Meeting sometime next week",
        "summary": "Meeting",
        "start": "2026-02-10T10:00:00Z",
        "end": "2026-02-10T11:00:00Z",
        "error": "Could not determine specific date",
        "reasoning": "No day of week or date specified",
        "createdAt": "2026-02-08T09:00:00Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Retry a Failed Event

If the failed event has start and end times, retry creating it directly:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://calendar-agent.intexuraos.com/failed-events/failed-001/retry" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

**Response (200 OK):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "event": {
      "id": "newEvent456",
      "summary": "Meeting",
      "start": { "dateTime": "2026-02-10T10:00:00Z" },
      "end": { "dateTime": "2026-02-10T11:00:00Z" }
    }
  }
}
```

The failed event record is automatically deleted after successful retry.

**Response (422 — Missing times):**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY",
    "message": "Cannot retry: missing start or end time"
  }
}
```

### Delete a Failed Event

Dismiss a failed event from the review queue:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://calendar-agent.intexuraos.com/failed-events/failed-001" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

**Response:** 204 No Content

## Troubleshooting

| Issue             | Symptom              | Solution                                             |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| NOT_CONNECTED     | 403 on all requests  | Connect Google account via user-service              |
| Invalid time      | 400 error            | Use ISO 8601 format with timezone                    |
| Event not found   | 404                  | Verify eventId and calendarId                        |
| Preview pending   | Status stays pending | Wait and poll, may take 2-5 seconds                  |
| Preview failed    | Status is failed     | Check error field, event saved for manual review     |
| Attendee ignored  | Attendee not added   | Ensure email is valid email address                  |
| Retry returns 422 | Missing start/end    | Failed event has no extracted times, create manually |
| Retry returns 404 | Wrong user           | Failed event belongs to a different user             |
| Auto-execute fail | Missing date/time    | Ensure `text` field has full user prompt, not title  |

## Best Practices

1. **Use synchronous preview** — For approval flows, use `POST /internal/calendar/preview` for immediate preview data
2. **Pass full prompt text** — Always send the complete user message via the `text` field in process-action, not just the short classifier title
3. **Always specify timeMin/timeMax** — Reduces data transfer and improves performance
4. **Use pagination** — Set maxResults to avoid fetching all events at once
5. **Handle partial success** — Free/busy may return some calendars with errors
6. **Implement caching** — Cache event data for short periods
7. **Respect rate limits** — Google Calendar has daily quota limits
8. **Display reasoning** — Show users why dates were interpreted a certain way
9. **Use resourceUrl** — The process-action response links directly to Google Calendar

## Exercises
