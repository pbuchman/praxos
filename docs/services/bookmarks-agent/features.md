# Bookmarks Agent

Save and organize links with automatic OpenGraph metadata extraction and AI-powered summaries.

## The Problem

Bookmarking today is limited:

1. **No metadata** - Basic bookmarks don't capture page title, description, or images
2. **Manual organization** - Users must manually categorize and tag bookmarks
3. **Lost links** - URLs break over time with no way to recover content
4. **No context** - Can't remember why you saved a link

## How It Helps

Bookmarks-agent provides intelligent bookmark management:

1. **Automatic metadata** - Fetches OpenGraph data (title, description, image, favicon)
2. **AI summaries** - Generates concise summaries of bookmarked content
3. **Tag-based filtering** - Organize bookmarks with custom tags
4. **Archive management** - Keep active bookmarks separate from archived ones
5. **Duplicate detection** - Prevents saving the same URL twice

## Use Cases

### Save a link from WhatsApp

1. User sends a URL via WhatsApp
2. Message triggers bookmark creation
3. Link preview fetches OpenGraph metadata
4. User can later filter by tags or search

### Archive old bookmarks

1. User no longer needs a bookmark
2. Archive it (soft delete)
3. Unarchive later if needed

## Key Benefits

**Rich metadata** - Title, description, images automatically fetched

**AI summaries** - Quick overview without visiting the page

**Tag-based filtering** - Organize by project, topic, or priority

**Soft delete** - Archive without losing data

**Duplicate prevention** - Avoids saving the same URL twice

## Limitations

**No full-text search** - Can only filter by tags and status

**No link checking** - Doesn't verify if URLs still work

**No folder hierarchy** - Tags are flat, no nested folders

**No sharing** - Bookmarks are private to each user

**No import/export** - Can't bulk import browser bookmarks
