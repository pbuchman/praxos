# Notes Agent

Simple note-taking service for IntexuraOS. Create, view, update, and delete text notes with tags.

## The Problem

Users need a quick way to capture information:

1. **Quick capture** - Save thoughts without complex formatting
2. **Organization** - Tag-based filtering
3. **Source tracking** - Know where each note came from

## How It Helps

Notes-agent provides minimal but functional note management:

- Create notes with title, content, and tags
- List notes with tag filtering
- Update note content
- Delete notes
- Track source (WhatsApp, web, etc.)

## Key Features

- **Draft status** - Notes can be created as draft before going active
- **Tag-based organization** - Filter notes by tags
- **Source tracking** - Know which system created each note

## Limitations

- No rich text or markdown formatting
- No note folders or hierarchies
- No search functionality
- No sharing or collaboration
- No revision history
