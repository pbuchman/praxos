# Code Agent - Technical Debt

**Last Updated:** 2026-06-12
**Analysis Run:** [2026-06-12 release 3.7.0 Service Scribe pass]

## Summary

| Category       | Count  | Severity |
| -------------- | ------ | -------- |
| TODO comments  | 2      | Medium   |
| Code smells    | 2      | Low-Med  |
| Future plans   | 3      | Medium   |
| TS strictness  | 2      | Low      |
| SRP violations | 0      | None     |
| **Total**      | **9**  | n/a      |

> Note: the INT-1430 route split is complete: `codeRoutes.ts` is now a composition plugin and route logic lives in resource-specific modules. Remaining release 3.7.0 debt centers on prompt hash auditability, distributed drain guards, and execution memory maturation.

## Future Plans

### 1. Actual system prompt versioning

Replace static hash placeholders with computed hashes from the real system prompt template. This enables prompt A/B testing and audit compliance.

**Files:** `domain/usecases/submitDirectCodeTask.ts:26`, `routes/code/task-routes.ts:1406`

### 2. Distributed drain queue guard

Per-user Firestore dispatch leases, attempt fencing, and durable review reservations now guard competing execution. The module-level drain guards remain local optimizations; future scaling reviews should assess recovery and lease behavior, rather than treating those booleans as the only dispatch protection.

### 3. Execution memory pipeline maturation

The execution memory graph is in alpha. Planned improvements include tuning rerank thresholds and scoring weights, refining distillation prompts for higher-quality memories, expanding component hints guidance, and improving the evaluation pipeline for post-run memory feedback. The `labelHints` signal was recently removed from the scoring pipeline after proving unreliable.

## TODO Comments

### 1. System prompt hash is a static placeholder

**File:** `apps/code-agent/src/domain/usecases/submitDirectCodeTask.ts:26`

```typescript
// TODO: Compute from actual system prompt content instead of using a static placeholder.
```

**File:** `apps/code-agent/src/routes/code/task-routes.ts:1406`

```typescript
systemPromptHash: 'default', // TODO: Use actual system prompt hash
```

The `systemPromptHash` field is designed for audit tracking - recording which version of the system prompt was active when the task ran. Currently it stores a hardcoded string, making it impossible to audit prompt version changes.

**Impact:** Audit trail gap - no way to correlate task results with the system prompt version that generated them.

**Remediation:** Compute SHA-256 of the actual system prompt template at startup and inject it via config.

## Code Smells

### 1. In-flight health probe deduplication uses module-level Map

**File:** `apps/code-agent/src/routes/code/task-routes.ts`

Module-level mutable state for deduplicating concurrent health probes. This map grows unbounded if entries are not cleaned up properly.

**Impact:** Potential memory leak in long-running instances if the cleanup logic has edge cases.

**Remediation:** Add a TTL-based cleanup or use a WeakMap pattern.

### 2. Drain queue guards use module-level booleans

**Files:** `domain/usecases/drainTaskQueue.ts`, `domain/usecases/drainRetryQueue.ts`

Module-level flags prevent redundant drain work within a process. Durable per-user dispatch leases and task-attempt checks additionally protect dispatch across processes.

**Impact:** The flags alone do not coordinate processes, but they are no longer the execution ownership boundary.

**Remediation:** Preserve the durable claim, fencing, and rollback checks when changing queue behavior.

## TypeScript Strictness Issues

### 1. Firestore Timestamp handling

Throughout the codebase, Firestore `Timestamp` objects require runtime type narrowing when serializing to JSON. The `timestampToIso()` helper handles this but requires `as` casts. This pattern appears in `routes/code/*`, `mergeQueueRoutes.ts`, and `issueGroupRoutes.ts` and could benefit from a typed wrapper.

### 2. Firestore adapter typing remains broad

**File:** `infra/firestore/firestoreCodeTaskRepository.ts`

The Firestore adapter is intentionally thin and delegates most shape work to sibling serializer and query-builder modules, but it still carries a file-level ESLint disable and broad internal casts in the `guarded()` helper:

```typescript
return asResult ? (out as Result<T, RepositoryError>) : ok(out as T);
```

**Impact:** Low - these are infrastructure-layer Firestore SDK coercions, not domain logic.

**Remediation:** Use typed Firestore converters and narrower helper overloads to remove the adapter-wide lint disable and internal casts.

## Test Coverage Notes

The service has 50+ test files covering domain models, use cases, infra adapters, and routes. Coverage exemptions use the `/* v8 ignore <CATEGORY> -- reason @preserve */` pattern with valid categories.

Common exemption categories in this service:

- `ts-type`: TypeScript type narrowing branches (nullish coalescing, optional chaining)
- `test-infra`: Paths requiring complex test infrastructure setup (e.g., FakeFirestore limitations)
- `upstream`: Error handling for external service failures

Several v8 ignore blocks were replaced with real tests in previous releases (INT-1071, INT-1072, INT-1073, INT-1237).

## Release Reliability Improvements

Since v3.8.0, SentryBox reservation and correlated-error deduplication, active remediation reuse, durable review locks, lifecycle timestamps, and merge-ready evidence address repeated work and stale task state. Existing tests cover those boundaries in the webhook, queue, review reservation, and task-group repository suites.
