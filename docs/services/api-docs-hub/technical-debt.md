## Summary

| Category    | Count | Severity |
| ----------- | ----- | -------- |
| Code Smells | 1     | Low      |
| Test Gaps   | 0     | -        |
| Type Issues | 0     | -        |
| TODOs       | 0     | -        |
| **Total**   | **1** | Low      |

## Future Plans

1. **Dynamic config reload** — Reload OpenAPI sources without requiring a full redeployment
2. **Spec caching** — Cache fetched specs server-side to improve load times and reduce dependency on service availability
3. **Authentication helper** — Built-in token management in the Swagger UI to reduce friction during API testing
4. **API version selector** — Support displaying multiple versions of each service's API
5. **Cross-spec search** — Global endpoint search across all aggregated services
6. **ecosystem.config.cjs integration** — Add api-docs-hub to the PM2 ecosystem config for local development parity

## Code Smells

### Low Priority

| File                               | Issue                                   | Impact                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/api-docs-hub/package.json`   | Unused `@intexuraos/common-core` dep    | Adds unnecessary weight to the dependency graph; import was removed from `config.ts` in v3.5.0     |

The health endpoint now uses the shared `registerHealthCheck()` helper. The config probe checks that sources exist; it does not check upstream availability.

The `@intexuraos/common-core` package is still listed as a dependency in `package.json` but is no longer imported anywhere in the source code. The shared `INTERNAL_API_SERVICE_CATALOG` was replaced by a local `OPEN_API_SOURCE_CATALOG` in `config.ts`. Removing the dependency would clean up the graph.

---

## Test Coverage Gaps

Tests cover both source files:
- `server.test.ts` — Health endpoint response shape and status, Swagger UI serving and OpenAPI spec generation
- `config.test.ts` — Environment variable validation (missing vars throw), URL trimming behavior

Coverage is adequate for this service's scope. There are no untested code paths in the current source.

---

## TypeScript Issues

None. No `any` types, no `@ts-ignore` comments, no `@ts-expect-error` annotations.

---

## TODOs / FIXMEs

None found in the codebase.

---

## SRP Violations

None. All three files have clear, single responsibilities:
- `config.ts` — Service catalog definition, environment variable validation, source list construction
- `server.ts` — Fastify setup with Swagger UI and health endpoint
- `index.ts` — Entry point with Sentry initialization

---

## Code Duplicates

The local `OPEN_API_SOURCE_CATALOG` in `config.ts` duplicates service names and env var mappings that also exist in `@intexuraos/common-core`'s `INTERNAL_API_SERVICE_CATALOG`. This was an intentional revert from the shared catalog approach. The duplication is limited to this one file and the catalog changes infrequently.

---

## Deprecations

None.
