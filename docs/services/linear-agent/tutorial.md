# Linear Agent — Tutorial

> **Time:** 45-55 minutes
> **Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, Linear account with API key, IntexuraOS running locally
> **You'll learn:** How to connect Linear, create issues via AI, view issues with parent-child support, read comments, configure webhooks, sync issues, use the internal API, fetch issue context, observe auto-triggered code tasks, and review AI-classified prune candidates

---

## What You'll Build

A working integration that:

- Connects your Linear workspace to IntexuraOS
- Creates issues from natural language via AI extraction
- Views issues grouped by workflow stage with sub-issues and labels
- Fetches issue detail and comments
- Configures webhooks for real-time issue sync with multi-user fan-out
- Triggers full issue synchronization
- Manages issues programmatically via the internal API (create, state, comments, labels, tree)
- Fetches issue context (description + comments) for cross-service use
- Observes auto-triggered code tasks on issue assignment
- Reviews and confirms AI-classified prune candidates
- Handles errors and reviews failed extractions

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] IntexuraOS running locally (`pnpm run dev`)
- [ ] A valid Auth0 access token
- [ ] Linear account with API key ([generate here](https://.app/settings/api))
- [ ] Linear team ID (visible in Linear settings)

---

## Part 1: Connect to Linear (5 minutes)

### Step 1.1: Validate Your API Key

First, validate your Linear API key and retrieve available teams.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/connection/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"apiKey": "lin_api_YOUR_KEY_HERE"}'
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "teams": [
      { "id": "team-uuid-123", "name": "Engineering", "key": "ENG" },
      { "id": "team-uuid-456", "name": "Product", "key": "PRD" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 1.2: Save the Connection

Save your Linear connection with your preferred team.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/connection \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "apiKey": "lin_api_YOUR_KEY_HERE",
    "teamId": "team-uuid-123",
    "teamName": "Engineering"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "connected": true,
    "teamId": "team-uuid-123",
    "teamName": "Engineering",
    "createdAt": "2026-03-07T10:00:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-03-07T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Step 1.3: Verify Connection Status

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/connection \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_TOKEN"
```

**Checkpoint:** You should see `"connected": true` with your team name.

---

## Part 2: Create Issues via AI (10 minutes)

Issues are created through the internal API by trusted services and synchronization flows.

### Step 2.1: Direct Internal API Call (Testing)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/internal/linear/process-action \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: your-internal-secret" \
  -d '{
    "action": {
      "id": "test-action-001",
      "userId": "YOUR_USER_ID",
      "text": "Create a bug report for the login button not responding on iOS. Users tap the button but nothing happens. This is high priority since it blocks mobile users."
    }
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "completed",
    "message": "Issue ENG-123 created successfully",
    "resourceUrl": "https://.app/your-team/issue/ENG-123"
  }
}
```

Note: Both success and failure return HTTP 200 — this is the `ServiceFeedback` contract. Check `status` to determine the outcome.

### Step 2.2: What the AI Extracts

| Field                       | Extracted Value                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Title**                   | Fix unresponsive login button on iOS                   |
| **Priority**                | 2 (High) — from "high priority"                        |
| **Functional Requirements** | Login button must respond to tap events on iOS devices |
| **Technical Details**       | Investigate touch event handling in iOS build          |

### Step 2.3: Test Priority Detection

Try different urgency levels:

**Urgent:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/internal/linear/process-action \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: your-internal-secret" \
  -d '{
    "action": {
      "id": "test-action-002",
      "userId": "YOUR_USER_ID",
      "text": "URGENT: Production database is timing out on all queries."
    }
  }'
```

Result: Priority 1 (Urgent)

**Low:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/internal/linear/process-action \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: your-internal-secret" \
  -d '{
    "action": {
      "id": "test-action-003",
      "userId": "YOUR_USER_ID",
      "text": "When you have time, it would be nice to add a dark mode toggle."
    }
  }'
```

Result: Priority 4 (Low)

### Step 2.4: Verify Idempotency

Re-send `test-action-001` with the same `id` — the service returns the existing result without creating a duplicate issue.

**Checkpoint:** All three issues should appear in your Linear workspace with correct priorities. Duplicate sends are harmless.

---

## Part 3: View Issues in Dashboard (5 minutes)

### Step 3.1: Initial Full Sync

The dashboard reads from local Firestore cache. Run a full sync first to populate it.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/sync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "created": 15,
    "updated": 0,
    "deleted": 0,
    "total": 15,
    "durationMs": 2340,
    "syncedAt": "2026-03-07T10:15:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Step 3.2: List Grouped Issues

Fetch issues grouped by dashboard column (from Firestore — no Linear API call).

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/issues \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_TOKEN"
```

Note how parent issues have their `children` array populated — sub-issues are nested under their parent. Issues sort by most recently updated within each column.

### Step 3.3: Get Issue Detail

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/issues/ENG-123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_TOKEN"
```

Returns issue with `commentCount`, `lastCommentAt`, labels with colors, and assignee data.

### Step 3.4: Fetch Issue Comments

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/issues/ENG-123/comments?limit=10&offset=0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_TOKEN"
```

Returns paginated comments with author names, markdown body, and timestamps.

**Checkpoint:** Issues load instantly from Firestore. Parent-child hierarchy is preserved. Comments are paginated.

---

## Part 4: Configure Webhooks (5 minutes)

Real-time sync: when something changes in Linear, the webhook fans out to all connected users for that team.

### Step 4.1: Get Webhook Configuration

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/webhook-config \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_TOKEN"
```

### Step 4.2: Set Up in Linear

1. Go to Linear Settings -> API -> Webhooks
2. Create a new webhook with the URL from step 4.1
3. Select "Issues" and "Comments" as resource types
4. Copy the webhook signing secret

### Step 4.3: Configure the Webhook Secret

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/webhook-config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"secret": "YOUR_LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET"}'
```

### Step 4.4: Verify Webhook is Active

Create or update an issue in Linear. The webhook fans out to all connected users for that team — each user's local Firestore store gets updated concurrently.

**Checkpoint:** After configuring the webhook, changes in Linear should appear in the local issue repository for all connected team members automatically.

---

## Part 5: Internal API for Code Agents (10 minutes)

Code agents use internal endpoints to manage issues programmatically. All internal endpoints require both `X-Internal-Auth` and `X-User-Id` headers.

### Step 5.1: Validate a Parent Issue

Confirm an issue exists and belongs to the user's connected team.

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/internal/linear/issues/ENG-100/validate?userId=YOUR_USER_ID" \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: your-internal-secret"
```

Returns issue `id`, `identifier`, `title`, `url`, `labels` (names only), `childCount`, and `parentId`.

### Step 5.2: Generate an Issue Title

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/internal/linear/issues/generate-title \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: your-internal-secret" \
  -d '{
    "description": "The sidebar crashes when clicking settings on iOS 17.",
    "userId": "YOUR_USER_ID"
  }'
```

**Expected response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "title": "Sidebar crashes on settings click in iOS 17",
    "issueType": "bug"
  }
}
```

The `issueType` is one of: `feature`, `bug`, `refactor`, `research`. Title generation retries once on failure — if both attempts fail, it returns an error rather than degrading silently.

### Step 5.3: Create an Issue

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/internal/issues \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: your-internal-secret" \
  -H "X-User-Id: YOUR_USER_ID" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Implement pagination for user list",
    "description": "Add cursor-based pagination to the GET /users endpoint."
  }'
```

**Expected response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid-...",
    "identifier": "ENG-44",
    "title": "Implement pagination for user list",
    "url": "https://.app/engineering/issue/ENG-44"
  }
}
```

### Step 5.4: Update Issue State

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/internal/issues/ISSUE_ID/state \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: your-internal-secret" \
  -H "X-User-Id: YOUR_USER_ID" \
  -d '{"state": "in_progress"}'
```

Available states: `backlog`, `todo`, `in_progress`, `in_review`, `qa`, `done`. The endpoint maps these to Linear workflow state names and resolves the state ID before updating.

### Step 5.5: Add a Comment

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/internal/linear/issues/ISSUE_ID/comments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: your-internal-secret" \
  -H "X-User-Id: YOUR_USER_ID" \
  -d '{"body": "Implementation started. Working on the pagination logic."}'
```

### Step 5.6: Update Labels and Assignee

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/internal/linear/issues/ISSUE_ID/metadata \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: your-internal-secret" \
  -H "X-User-Id: YOUR_USER_ID" \
  -d '{
    "addLabels": ["in-progress"],
    "removeLabels": ["backlog"]
  }'
```

Labels are resolved by name. Unknown label names are silently dropped — verify labels exist in your Linear workspace. The endpoint also performs a write-through cache update and notifies code-agent to recompute group summaries.

### Step 5.7: Batch Fetch Issues for Display

Retrieve multiple issues with their comment counts in a single request.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/internal/linear/issues/display-batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: your-internal-secret" \
  -H "X-User-Id: YOUR_USER_ID" \
  -d '{"identifiers": ["ENG-100", "ENG-101", "ENG-102"]}'
```

Missing identifiers are omitted from the response. Results preserve the input order. Sub-tasks include `parentIdentifier` for breadcrumb navigation.

### Step 5.8: Get Issue Tree

Fetch an issue and all its recursive descendants from local Firestore data — no Linear API call.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/internal/issues/ISSUE_ID/tree \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: your-internal-secret" \
  -H "X-User-Id: YOUR_USER_ID"
```

### Step 5.9: Fetch Issue Context

Retrieve an issue's description and comments for cross-service use — no `X-User-Id` required.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/internal/linear/issues/ENG-100/context \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: your-internal-secret"
```

**Expected response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "description": "The onboarding wizard crashes when company name is skipped...",
    "comments": [
      { "body": "Confirmed — reproducible on step 2.", "createdAt": "2026-03-20T14:30:00Z" },
      { "body": "Looks like a validation issue.", "createdAt": "2026-03-20T10:15:00Z" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Comments are sorted newest-first, capped at 100, with empty bodies filtered. This endpoint does not require user scoping — it is designed for service-to-service calls.

### Step 5.10: Get Direct Children from Linear

Fetch live direct children of an issue from the Linear API (not from local cache).

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/internal/linear/issues/ISSUE_ID/direct-children \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: your-internal-secret" \
  -H "X-User-Id: YOUR_USER_ID"
```

**Checkpoint:** You can create issues, generate titles, validate identifiers, move through the workflow, add comments, update metadata, fetch batches, traverse trees, retrieve issue context, and get live children using the internal API.

---

## Retry Issue Creation Safely

When integrating error remediation with `POST /internal/issues`, include a stable `idempotencyKey` alongside `title` and `description`, and retain it if the response is lost or a transient failure occurs. Repeating that logical request returns the same issue; use a new key for a different issue.

For webhook troubleshooting, verify the team secret and synced issue context before retrying. Missing authentication context is rejected, including for event types that the service does not process.

## Part 6: Auto-Trigger Code Tasks (3 minutes)

When an issue with a "planning-task" or "code-task" label is assigned for the first time, the Linear Agent automatically triggers a code task.

### How It Works

The auto-trigger fires when all of these conditions are met:

1. A webhook `update` event arrives
2. The issue had no previous assignee (`updatedFrom.assigneeId` is null)
3. The issue now has an assignee
4. The issue is in a `backlog` or `unstarted` state
5. The issue has a `planning-task` or `code-task` label

The prompt depends on the label:

- **`code-task` label:** Execution prompt — implement requirements, write code, run CI, create PR
- **`planning-task` label:** Assignment prompt — analyze issue, enrich description with requirements and acceptance criteria, mark ready for execution

Both prompts instruct the code agent to read the full issue and all its comments (newest-first) before starting work.

### Test the Auto-Trigger

1. Create a new issue in Linear (status: Todo, no assignee, add a "planning-task" label)
2. Assign yourself to the issue
3. Check the linear-agent logs for: `Code task triggered from assignment`

**Checkpoint:** The code agent starts working on the issue within seconds. The trigger is fire-and-forget — failures appear in logs, not in the webhook response.

---

## Part 7: Review and Delete Prune Candidates (5 minutes)

When your board grows past 200 active issues, the Linear Agent classifies deletion candidates using a user-service-resolved LLM client with a platform OpenRouter fallback.

### Step 7.1: Trigger Pruning Manually (Testing)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/internal/linear/prune-issues \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: your-internal-secret"
```

If you have more than 200 issues, you will receive a response with `storedCandidates`. If below threshold, you will see `"skipped": true`.

### Step 7.2: Review Candidates

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/prune-candidates \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_TOKEN"
```

Each candidate includes `identifier`, `title`, `score` (0-100), `reason`, and `category` (cancelled, duplicate, sub-issue, simple-fix, review-only, or other).

### Step 7.3: Confirm Deletion

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/prune-candidates \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_TOKEN"
```

**Expected response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "deleted": 12,
    "failedDeletions": [],
    "durationMs": 3456
  }
}
```

Issues are soft-deleted from Linear (recoverable) and removed from all connected users' local Firestore copies.

**Checkpoint:** Prune candidates are classified by AI, presented for review, and deleted only after explicit confirmation.

---

## Part 8: Handle Errors (5 minutes)

### Error: Not Connected

**Solution:** Complete Part 1 to connect your Linear account.

### Error: Stale Dashboard Data

The dashboard reads from Firestore cache. Trigger a full sync:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/sync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_TOKEN"
```

### Error: Extraction Failed

List and retry failed extractions:

```bash
# List failed issues
curl http://localhost:3000/failed-issues \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_TOKEN"

# Retry a failed issue
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/failed-issues/FAILED_ID/retry \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_TOKEN"

# Delete a failed issue
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/failed-issues/FAILED_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_TOKEN"
```

## Exercises

### Easy

1. Connect your Linear account and verify `connected: true`.
2. Create an issue with no urgency keywords — confirm it defaults to Normal (priority 3).
3. Trigger a full sync and verify the created/updated counts.

### Medium

4. Create issues with all four priority levels (urgent, high, normal, low) and verify them in Linear.
5. Configure a webhook and verify real-time sync by updating an issue in Linear.
6. Send vague input ("fix bug") — find it in the failed-issues queue, then delete it.
7. Use the batch display endpoint to fetch three issues with their comment counts in one call.
8. Use the context endpoint to fetch an issue's description and comments.
9. Review prune candidates (if above threshold) and confirm deletion.

### Hard

10. Simulate the full code-agent workflow: create an issue with `POST /internal/issues`, move it to `in_progress`, add a comment, update a label, then move it to `done`.
11. Create a parent issue in Linear, create two sub-issues, run a full sync, then verify the tree structure with `GET /internal/issues/:issueId/tree`.
12. Test the auto-trigger: create an issue with a `planning-task` label, assign it, and trace the log output to confirm the code agent receives the task.

### Exercise 4: All Priority Levels

```bash
# Urgent (1)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/internal/linear/process-action \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: your-internal-secret" \
  -d '{"action": {"id": "ex4-1", "userId": "USER", "text": "URGENT: Server is down"}}'

# High (2)

### Exercise 8: Fetch Issue Context

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/internal/linear/issues/ENG-100/context \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: your-internal-secret"
```

Verify the response contains `description` (string or null) and `comments` array sorted newest-first.

### Exercise 9: Review Prune Candidates

```bash
# List candidates
curl http://localhost:3000/prune-candidates \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_TOKEN"

# Confirm deletion
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/prune-candidates \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_TOKEN"
```

### Exercise 10: Full Code-Agent Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create issue
ISSUE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/internal/issues \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Internal-Auth: your-internal-secret" \
  -H "X-User-Id: USER" \
  -d '{"title": "Fix login on iOS", "description": "Users cannot sign in on iOS."}')
ISSUE_ID=$(echo $ISSUE | jq -r '.data.id')

# 2. Move to in_progress
curl -X PATCH "http://localhost:3000/internal/issues/$ISSUE_ID/state" \
