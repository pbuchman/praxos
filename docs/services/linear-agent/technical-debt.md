## TODOs / FIXMEs

None. No TODO, FIXME, HACK, or XXX comments in production source code.

---

## Future Plans

Based on code analysis, git history, and domain patterns:

1. **Issue Updates from WhatsApp**: Support updating existing issues from WhatsApp (currently create-only via voice pipeline)
2. **Project Selection**: Allow users to select target project within team (not just team-level)
3. **Label Inference**: Extract labels from natural language context ("this is a bug" adds `bug` label)
4. **Due Date Extraction**: Parse relative dates ("by Friday", "next week") into Linear due dates
5. **Multi-Issue Splitting**: Parse complex descriptions into multiple related issues
6. **Assignee Suggestion**: Suggest assignee based on historical patterns or explicit mentions
7. **Label Support in Internal API**: The `POST /internal/issues` endpoint accepts `labels` but does not pass them to the Linear API yet
8. **completedAt in SyncedLinearIssue**: `SyncedLinearIssue` does not store `completedAt`; `updatedAt` is used as a proxy for archive cutoff. Adding `completedAt` would improve accuracy for issues completed long after their last update.
9. **Comment Full Sync**: Comments are only synced via webhooks; a comment full-sync capability for initial setup would be valuable
10. **Configurable Prune Threshold**: The pruning activation threshold (200 issues) is hardcoded in `PRUNE_CONFIG`. Making it user-configurable would support different workspace sizes.
11. **Prune Candidate Exclusion List**: Allow users to protect specific issues from being classified as prune candidates (e.g., evergreen tracking issues)

## Code Smells

### Low Priority

| File                                                   | Issue                          | Impact                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/infra/linearApiClient.ts`                  | Module-level client cache      | Global state, harder to test in isolation                     |
| `src/domain/useCases/triggerCodeTaskFromAssignment.ts` | Fire-and-forget async pattern  | Errors logged but not propagated to caller                    |

**Details (client cache):** The Linear API client uses module-level `Map` instances for client caching and request deduplication. While this enables performance optimizations, it makes the code harder to test without coverage exemption pragmas. The caching and dedup logic has been extracted into a dedicated `requestCache.ts` module (INT-904), improving isolation.

**Mitigation:** The caching behavior is well-isolated with exported functions (`clearClientCache`, `getClientCacheSize`) for test cleanup. The INT-904 split further improved testability.

**Details (fire-and-forget):** `triggerCodeTaskFromAssignment` uses `void` to discard the promise, meaning code-agent failures are only logged, not surfaced to the webhook caller. This is by design (webhook responses should not be blocked), but means trigger failures require log monitoring to detect.

## Test Coverage Gaps

None identified. Current coverage meets the 100% branch threshold with valid v8 ignore exemptions across 16 production source files. All exemptions use documented categories: `test-infra`, `ts-type`, `async-timing`, `upstream`, `schema`.

---

## TypeScript Issues

None identified. One `@ts-expect-error` exists in test code (`linearActionExtractionService.test.ts`) for intentional negative testing of schema validation — this is valid usage. No `any` types in production source code. Service uses strict TypeScript with proper type definitions for all domain models including the new pruning types (`PruneCandidate`, `StoredPruneCandidate`, `PruneConfig`, `PruneStats`, `PruneDeleteStats`).

## SRP Violations

| File                             | Lines  | Status                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `internalIssuesRoutes.ts`        | ~1,101 | Over threshold (10 endpoints). Should split                            |
| `linearRoutes.ts`                | ~1,052 | Over threshold (16 endpoints). Should split                            |
| `internalRoutes.ts`              | ~694   | Borderline (6 endpoints including prune-issues)                        |
| `linearApiClient.ts`             | ~361   | OK (reduced from ~636 via INT-904 split)                               |
| `linearMappers.ts`               | ~241   | OK (extracted from linearApiClient)                                    |
| `linearWebhookRoutes.ts`         | ~227   | OK                                                                     |
| `processLinearAction.ts`         | ~207   | OK                                                                     |
| `pruneIssuesUseCase.ts`          | ~143   | OK                                                                     |
| `confirmPruneDeletionUseCase.ts` | ~125   | OK                                                                     |

| `listIssues.ts`                  | ~93    | OK (reduced from ~208 via INT-906 decomposition)                       |

**Note:** `internalIssuesRoutes.ts` has grown to ~1,101 lines with 10 endpoints: create, comments, metadata, state, display-batch, get-by-identifier, context, tree, and direct-children. This file should be split into focused modules (e.g., `internalIssueDisplayRoutes.ts` for read-only display endpoints, `internalIssueMutationRoutes.ts` for write operations).

**Note:** `linearRoutes.ts` has grown to ~1,052 lines with the addition of prune-candidates endpoints (GET and DELETE). Consider extracting prune-related routes into a dedicated `linearPruneRoutes.ts`.

## Code Duplicates

### Handled via Shared Code

| Pattern         | Locations                                                         | Status                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Error handling  | `linearRoutes.ts`, `internalRoutes.ts`, `internalIssuesRoutes.ts` | Shared `handleLinearError`         |
| Request logging | All routes                                                        | Uses `logIncomingRequest`          |
| Auth validation | Public routes                                                     | Uses `requireAuth`                 |
| Internal auth   | Internal routes                                                   | Uses `validateInternalAuth`        |
| Issue mapping   | `syncSingleIssue`, `fullSync`                                     | Shared `issueMapper` module        |
| Display build   | `internalIssuesRoutes.ts` (3 endpoints)                           | Shared `buildIssueDisplayResponse` |

---

## Deprecations

None. The service uses current versions of:

- `@linear/sdk` — Official Linear SDK
- `@intexuraos/llm-prompts` — Internal prompt library (includes `linearIssueTitlePrompt`, `linearActionExtractionPrompt`)
- `@intexuraos/llm-utils` — Zod error formatting
- `@intexuraos/common-core` — Result types, label detection helpers
- `@intexuraos/internal-clients` — UserServiceClient
- `@intexuraos/llm-factory` — Provider-neutral LLM client interface

---

## Release Reliability Improvements

Since v3.8.0, deterministic internal issue IDs and post-create race recovery protect retrying remediation requests. Issue-list page retries and typed `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` mapping distinguish transient failures from authentication problems. Webhook authentication now precedes event filtering. Existing internal-route, webhook, and Linear mapper/client tests cover these cases.

## Code Quality Notes

### Positive Patterns

1. **Idempotency**: ProcessedAction repository prevents duplicate issue creation (INT-97)
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Failed extractions saved for manual review with retry capability
3. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript types including `LinearLabel` with color for full label fidelity
4. **Error Mapping**: Consistent error code translation to HTTP status across all route files via shared `handleLinearError`
5. **Performance**: Client caching and request deduplication (INT-95)
6. **Clean Separation**: Domain logic isolated from infrastructure with well-defined ports
7. **Firestore-First Dashboard**: No Linear API call on dashboard load — fast and rate-limit-proof
8. **Parent-Child Hierarchy**: In-memory tree built from Firestore data; subissues display correctly with parent breadcrumbs
9. **Multi-Tenant Webhooks**: Per-connection webhook secrets with team-based routing
10. **Safe Parsing**: Issue mapper handles unknown state types and out-of-range priorities with defaults
11. **Retry Logic**: Title generation retries once before returning a clean error
12. **OIDC + Internal Auth**: sync-all and prune-issues accept both Cloud Scheduler OIDC and internal auth tokens
13. **Signature Security**: HMAC-SHA256 with timing-safe comparison prevents timing attacks
14. **Comment Sync**: Comments stored in Firestore and exposed via paginated API
15. **HTTP Boundary Type Mapping**: `validateIssue` maps `LinearLabel[]` to `string[]` at the route layer — domain types stay clean
16. **Auto-Trigger on Assignment**: Webhook-driven code task creation with strict guard conditions
17. **Assignee Preservation**: Full sync preserves assignee data from the Linear API for dashboard display
18. **Multi-User Webhook Fan-Out**: Webhooks fan out to all connected users per team via `Promise.allSettled` (INT-623)
19. **Composite Document Keys**: `userId_issueId` keys prevent cross-user data overwrite in shared Firestore collections
20. **Dual-Prompt Code Task**: Prompt selection based on `code-task` label — enrichment vs execution
21. **Display Batch Endpoint**: `POST /internal/linear/issues/display-batch` returns multiple issues in a single call with batched Firestore reads
22. **Issue Tree Traversal**: `GET /internal/issues/:issueId/tree` returns recursive descendants from local sync data without Linear API calls
23. **Already-Completed Flow**: `done` state support enables enforcement pipeline to close issues when work is already merged (INT-773)
24. **Comments in Agent Prompts**: Both ASSIGNMENT_PROMPT and EXECUTION_PROMPT instruct the code agent to read all issue comments newest-first
25. **Module Decomposition**: INT-901 through INT-907 decomposed six large modules into focused, testable units
26. **Context Proxy**: Context endpoint enables cross-service issue data access without user credentials (INT-1040)
27. **Two-Phase Pruning**: LLM-classified candidates are stored for user review before deletion — no silent mass deletions
28. **Write-Through Label Cache**: Metadata endpoint updates Firestore immediately after Linear API call, preventing stale labels
29. **Group Summary Recomputes**: Label changes via internal API trigger code-agent group summary recalculation
30. **Zod-Validated LLM Output**: Pruning classifier validates model responses with strict Zod schemas

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Label Passthrough**: Internal API accepts labels but does not forward them to Linear on creation
2. **completedAt Gap**: SyncedLinearIssue uses `updatedAt` as proxy for archive cutoff
3. **Module-Level State**: Client cache uses global state (isolated but harder to test)
4. **Route File Size**: `internalIssuesRoutes.ts` at ~1,101 lines and `linearRoutes.ts` at ~1,052 lines need splitting
5. **Comment Full Sync**: No bulk comment reconciliation for initial setup
6. **Fire-and-Forget Auto-Trigger**: `triggerCodeTaskFromAssignment` errors only logged, not surfaced
7. **Hardcoded Prune Threshold**: 200-issue activation threshold is not user-configurable
