# Research Agent — Technical Reference

## Overview

Research-agent orchestrates parallel AI research across a curated OpenRouter model catalog. It infers structured research context from user prompts, fans out research via Pub/Sub so each model call runs in its own Cloud Run instance, flags low-quality responses, tracks token usage and cost per call via centralized LLM usage reporting, synthesizes results with source attribution, and auto-publishes shareable HTML to GCS. Google/Gemini execution is OpenRouter-only: executable IDs use `or:google/...`, raw `gemini-*` IDs are rejected, and no Google LLM API key is loaded. Runs on Cloud Run with auto-scaling.

## Recent Changes

### Changes since v3.8.0

- Research, synthesis, titles, context inference, and validation use OpenRouter with a user key or platform fallback. New runs and retries enforce the curated research allowlist; synthesis accepts only MiniMax M3 or GPT-5.4 through their `or:` IDs. Historical direct-provider records remain readable but cannot execute.
- Internal creation returns an absolute `resourceUrl` built from `INTEXURAOS_WEB_APP_URL`, allowing assistants to send a usable research link (INT-1708).
- Handled model failures and missing cover images retain their recovery behavior without duplicate actionable error alerts. Recovered parser diagnostics are debug-level; cover failure still permits publishing the report without an image (INT-2064, INT-2065, INT-2066).

The entries below are historical release records. They describe the behavior introduced at each release, not the current runtime contract; the current contract is OpenRouter-only as documented above.

### v3.6.0 Changes (since v3.5.0)

**Centralized LLM Pricing Removal (INT-1387):** The service no longer maintains its own `PricingClient` or depends on `app-settings-service` for pricing data. All LLM usage reporting is now handled via `HttpInternalAuthUsageSink` from the `llm-pricing` package, which sends usage data directly to `llm-usage-service`. The `infra/pricing/` directory and associated startup pricing fetch were removed entirely.

**Model Migration:** All call sites migrated from `gpt-5.2` / `claude-sonnet-4-5` / `claude-opus-4-5` to `gpt-5.4` / `claude-sonnet-4-6` / `claude-opus-4-6`. The stale model identifiers were removed from the LLM contract.

**Required promptType in LLM Calls (INT-1392):** The `promptType` parameter is now required in all `LlmGenerateClient` calls. All research-agent call sites were updated with semantic prompt type labels (e.g., `research`, `synthesis`, `title-generation`, `context-inference`, `input-validation`).

**OpenRouter Allowlist Expansion:** Added `google/gemini-3-flash-preview` to the curated OpenRouter allowlist, bringing the total to 15 models from 10 providers. The allowlist length assertion in the route test is now computed dynamically rather than hardcoded.

**Important WhatsApp Notifications:** Research completion and LLM failure notifications are now published with `important: true`, ensuring priority delivery through the WhatsApp notification pipeline.

**Export Branding Fix:** The exported HTML header now uses the web app URL for branding, and the "Generated by" section no longer includes the user's email address.

### v3.5.0 Changes (since v3.4.0)

**OpenRouter Integration (INT-1011, INT-1012, INT-1102, INT-1106, INT-1253):** Full backend infrastructure for routing research tasks through OpenRouter models.

- **OpenRouterAdapter:** New LLM adapter implementing both `LlmResearchProvider` and `LlmSynthesisProvider` via the `infra-openrouter` package. Strips the `or:` prefix from model IDs before passing to the OpenRouter API. Supports research, synthesis, and title generation.
- **Allowlist enforcement:** Execution-time validation ensures only the curated models from 10 providers can be dispatched through OpenRouter. Unauthorized model IDs are rejected.
- **Live pricing endpoint:** `GET /openrouter/models` returns the curated allowlist enriched with live pricing from the OpenRouter catalog API. Results are cached in-memory for 5 minutes. Falls back to hardcoded pricing when the catalog is unavailable.
- **Key validation:** OpenRouter API keys are validated using the lightweight `/api/v1/key` endpoint rather than making a full model call.
- **Pricing correlation:** OpenRouter models use `useProviderCost: true` pricing when live catalog data is available, falling back to allowlist-defined per-token pricing otherwise.

**Cover Image Provider Failover (INT-1310):** The `generateCoverImage` function now tries multiple image generation pipelines in order of preference. If the preferred provider fails (prompt generation or image generation), the service falls back to the next available provider. Provider preference is determined by the synthesis model: GPT-based synthesis prefers the OpenAI pipeline; all others prefer Google. All failures across providers are logged with structured error details.

**ResearchSummary Projection:** The `GET /` list endpoint now returns lightweight `ResearchSummary` projections instead of full `Research` documents. Summaries exclude large text fields (`synthesizedResult`, `llmResults[].result`, `inputContexts[].content`) to reduce payload size on list views. Uses single-query Firestore pagination via `.select()`.

**Other Changes:**

- Added `construction_building` domain to context inference (INT-1100)
- Fixed model count discrepancy in research request validation (INT-1107)

### v3.4.0 Changes (since v3.3.0)

**Research Pipeline Quality Fixes (INT-981):** Accuracy and completeness improvements across research stages T0 through T6:

- **Context-aware research prompts (T0-T2):** The `LlmResearchProvider.research()` method now accepts an optional `ResearchContext` parameter. All four LLM adapters (Claude, Gemini, GPT, Perplexity) pass the inferred research context through `buildResearchPrompt()` to produce domain-tailored prompts — including language, answer style, source preferences, and safety constraints.
- **Low-quality response detection (T3):** LLM results below 800 characters are automatically flagged with `qualityFlag: 'low_quality'` on the `LlmResult` model. Flagged results receive a quality warning prefix during synthesis, deprioritizing them as evidence sources.
- **Language-aware synthesis (T5):** When the research context includes a `language` field, it is passed as `languageOverride` to the synthesis context inferrer, ensuring the final output matches the user's language.
- **Context inference improvements (T6):** The context inference adapter now recognizes broader domain categories (e.g., `outdoor_recreation`, `fishing`, `construction_building`) and supports `user_exclusions` in safety constraints.

## LLM Models

Research Agent reports usage to `llm-usage-service` for every model it invokes. The current routed catalog is the 16-model OpenRouter allowlist:

**Research models** (`or:` prefix required in API payloads):
- DeepSeek V4 Flash (DeepSeek)
- Qwen 3.5 Plus, Qwen 3.5 Flash (Qwen)
- MiniMax M3 (MiniMax)
- Grok 4.20 Beta, Grok 4.3 (xAI)
- Kimi K2.5 (Moonshot)
- Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Opus 4.6 (Anthropic via OpenRouter)
- Gemini 3.1 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 3.6 Flash (Google via OpenRouter)
- GPT-5.4, GPT-5.4 Mini (OpenAI via OpenRouter)
- MiMo V2.5 Pro (Xiaomi)
- GLM 5 Turbo (Z.ai)

**Synthesis models:** `or:minimax/minimax-m3` (default) and `or:openai/gpt-5.4`. The research allowlist is broader than this synthesis subset.

**Fast model** (title generation, context inference, input validation):
- `or:minimax/minimax-m3` (platform OpenRouter default)

**Image model** (optional cover image generation):
- `gpt-image-1` public alias, executed as `openai/gpt-image-1` through OpenRouter

Stored direct-provider model names remain readable for historical data compatibility. New execution and retries require allowlisted `or:` IDs; historical direct Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity IDs cannot be executed. Synthesis also checks its narrower supported subset.

## Gotchas

- **Pub/Sub ack pattern:** All internal Pub/Sub endpoints always return `200 OK`. Errors are logged but never cause a 4xx/5xx response — otherwise Cloud Pub/Sub would redeliver indefinitely.
- **LLM call idempotency:** `process-llm-call` checks if the model result is already `completed` or `failed` before re-executing. Safe to redeliver.
- **Synthesis race guard:** `runSynthesis` checks for `synthesizing` or `completed` status before proceeding, preventing duplicate synthesis from concurrent Pub/Sub deliveries.
- **Enhanced research cost tracking:** When enhancing a completed research, completed LLM results are copied with `copiedFromSource: true`. Their costs are aggregated into `sourceLlmCostUsd` so `totalCostUsd` reflects only new work.
- **Notion export is fire-and-forget:** The export runs asynchronously after the database is saved. Failure does not affect the research's `completed` status.
- **Notion export timing:** The export must happen after the database save so it reads the updated `shareInfo.coverImageUrl`. An earlier race condition (export before save) was fixed.
- **Attribution repair:** If synthesis output fails attribution validation, the service automatically calls the synthesizer again to repair it. The repair's cost is tracked in `auxiliaryCostUsd`.
- **Context labels:** If no label is supplied for an input context, `generateContextLabels` assigns one via LLM inference during synthesis.
- **Low-quality threshold:** LLM results under 800 characters are flagged `low_quality`. The threshold was chosen empirically — useful research responses are typically 1000+ characters; shorter outputs usually indicate refusals, error messages, or extremely shallow answers.
- **Research context propagation:** The inferred `ResearchContext` is saved to Firestore during `process-research` and passed to each LLM adapter's `research()` call via `buildResearchPrompt()`. This means the context is inferred once and reused for all models in the research.
- **OpenRouter `or:` prefix:** OpenRouter model IDs are prefixed with `or:` in the llm-contract registry (e.g., `or:qwen/qwen3.5-plus-02-15`). The `OpenRouterAdapter` strips this prefix before calling the OpenRouter API using `getOpenRouterRawId()`.
- **No direct Google route:** Raw `gemini-*` IDs are not executable. Google model families must use an allowlisted `or:google/...` identifier and the OpenRouter credential.
- **OpenRouter allowlist enforcement:** At execution time (not just at selection), the `process-llm-call` handler validates that OpenRouter models are on the curated allowlist. Unauthorized model IDs are rejected.
- **OpenRouter model cache:** The `GET /openrouter/models` endpoint caches responses in-memory for 5 minutes. The cache is per-process, not shared across Cloud Run instances.
- **OpenRouter cover images:** `generateCoverImage` uses OpenRouter while preserving the `gpt-4.1` and `gpt-image-1` public aliases. If access is unavailable or either step fails, sharing continues without a cover image.
- **ResearchSummary projection:** The `GET /` list endpoint uses `findSummariesByUserId` which returns `ResearchSummary` objects (no `synthesizedResult`, no `llmResults[].result`, no `inputContexts[].content`). The `toResearchSummary` mapper strips these fields server-side.
- **Important WhatsApp notifications:** Both research completion and LLM failure notifications are published with `important: true`, bypassing quiet-hours suppression in the WhatsApp notification pipeline.
- **Usage reporting via HttpInternalAuthUsageSink:** Each LLM adapter receives a `UsageSink` scoped to its component name (e.g., `research:or:google/gemini-3.6-flash`, `synthesis:or:anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`, `title-generator`). Usage is reported asynchronously to `llm-usage-service` after each call completes.
