## Future Plans

- Define a proper port interface for `NotionServiceClient` in the domain layer to remove the `as never` cast in `runSynthesis` (currently tracked as a TODO in `runSynthesis.ts`)
- Extract `LlmCallPublisher` interface duplication — the same interface is redeclared in both `processResearch.ts` and `retryFromFailed.ts` instead of sharing a single definition
- Consider moving the Notion export use case (`exportResearchToNotionUseCase.ts`) from `infra/` to `domain/` or a dedicated `usecases/` location to align with the existing use-case organization pattern

## Code Smells

### Medium Priority

| File                                              | Issue                                                                                          | Impact                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/domain/usecases/processResearch.ts` | `LlmCallPublisher` interface duplicated in `retryFromFailed.ts` — same shape, two definitions  | Changing one requires updating both; drift risk             |
| `src/infra/notion/notionResearchExporter.ts`      | `LocalNotionError` / `LocalNotionErrorCode` types shadow the imported package types            | Fragile error mapping; package upgrade may diverge silently |

---

## Test Coverage Gaps

No significant gaps identified. The service maintains high test coverage across domain use cases, infra adapters (including the OpenRouterAdapter), and route handlers. The `v8-ignore` blocks in `processResearch.ts`, `runSynthesis.ts`, and `openRouterRoutes.ts` are properly justified with testing-blocker explanations and use valid exemption categories.

## TypeScript Issues

### Medium Priority

| File                                           | Issue                                                                                                   | Count |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| `src/domain/usecases/runSynthesis.ts` | `notionServiceClient` typed as `unknown` with `as never` cast to bypass domain layer import restriction | 1     |

**Context:** The `RunSynthesisDeps` interface declares `notionServiceClient?: unknown` and casts it with `notionServiceClient as never` when passing to `exportResearchToNotionUseCase`. This is an acknowledged architectural boundary workaround — the domain layer cannot import from `infra/`. The fix is to define a `NotionExporterPort` interface in `domain/ports/` and implement it in the infra layer.

## TODOs / FIXMEs

| File                                               | Comment                                               | Priority |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `src/domain/usecases/runSynthesis.ts:414` | `TODO: define port interface for NotionServiceClient` | Low      |

---

## SRP Violations

No violations. The largest files (`researchRoutes.ts`, `internalRoutes.ts`) are appropriately large because they contain multiple related route definitions with full schema declarations — this is an intentional Fastify pattern, not a SRP issue.

## Code Duplicates

| Pattern                      | Locations                                                                                            | Suggestion                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `LlmCallPublisher` interface | `src/domain/usecases/processResearch.ts`, `src/domain/usecases/retryFromFailed.ts` | Extract to `src/domain/ports/index.ts` |

---

## Deprecations

Direct-provider research execution was retired after v3.8.0. Stored historical records remain readable; new execution and retries require an allowlisted OpenRouter model, with a narrower MiniMax M3/GPT-5.4 synthesis subset. Retained historical adapters are not alternate execution routes.

Cover-image provider failover was replaced by a single OpenRouter pipeline. A handled failure leaves the report publishable without a cover and does not produce a duplicate actionable alert.
