# Research Agent — Tutorial

> **Time:** 20-30 minutes
> **Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, valid Auth0 access token, an OpenRouter credential resolvable by user-service
> **You'll learn:** How to submit research, poll for completion, understand partial failures, use OpenRouter models, and enhance existing results

---

## What You'll Build

A working integration that:

- Submits a multi-model research prompt and receives a synthesized report
- Polls research status and handles the full lifecycle
- Handles partial failures with user confirmation
- Browses available OpenRouter models with live pricing
- Enhances a completed research with additional context

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] Access to the IntexuraOS project
- [ ] A valid Auth0 bearer token (obtain via the web app login flow)
- [ ] An OpenRouter credential available through user-service (user key or platform fallback)
- [ ] `curl` and `jq` installed for the examples

Set your token and base URL:

```bash
export TOKEN="your-auth0-bearer-token"
export BASE_URL="https://your-research-agent-url"
```

---

## Part 1: Submit Your First Research (5 minutes)

### Step 1.1: Submit a Research Request

Use allowlisted `or:` IDs for research. Choose `or:minimax/minimax-m3` or `or:openai/gpt-5.4` for synthesis; other research models are not valid synthesis choices. Historical direct-provider IDs can be read in saved results but cannot be retried.

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "What are the main tradeoffs between PostgreSQL and MongoDB for a SaaS product?",
    "selectedModels": ["or:google/gemini-3.6-flash", "or:anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6"],
    "synthesisModel": "or:minimax/minimax-m3"
  }' | jq .
```

**Expected response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "res_abc123",
    "status": "pending",
    "title": "",
    "prompt": "What are the main tradeoffs...",
    "selectedModels": ["or:google/gemini-3.6-flash", "or:anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6"],
    "synthesisModel": "or:minimax/minimax-m3",
    "llmResults": [
      { "model": "or:google/gemini-3.6-flash", "status": "pending" },
      { "model": "or:anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6", "status": "pending" }
    ],
    "startedAt": "2026-03-15T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

Save the research ID:

```bash
export RESEARCH_ID="res_abc123"
```

### What Just Happened?

Research Agent saved the research to Firestore with status `pending` and published a `research.process` event to Pub/Sub. The processing runs asynchronously — the response comes back immediately without waiting for LLM calls. During processing, the service infers a structured research context from your prompt (domain, answer style, source preferences) and uses it to build tailored prompts for each model.

---

## Part 2: Poll for Completion (10 minutes)

Research processing is asynchronous. Poll the status endpoint until the research reaches `completed` or `failed`.

### Step 2.1: Check Research Status

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/$RESEARCH_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq '.data.status'
```

The status progresses through this lifecycle:

```
pending -> processing -> synthesizing -> completed
                      \-> awaiting_confirmation (partial failure)
                      \-> failed (all models failed)
```

### Step 2.2: Simple Poll Loop

```bash
while true; do
  STATUS=$(curl -s "$BASE_URL/$RESEARCH_ID" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq -r '.data.status')
  echo "Status: $STATUS"
  if [ "$STATUS" = "completed" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "failed" ]; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 5
done
```

### Step 2.3: Read the Completed Result

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/$RESEARCH_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  | jq '{
      title: .data.title,
      status: .data.status,
      totalCostUsd: .data.totalCostUsd,
      synthesizedResult: (.data.synthesizedResult | .[0:500]),
      shareUrl: .data.shareInfo.shareUrl
    }'
```

**Checkpoint:** You should see the synthesized markdown report, a title generated from your prompt, cost in USD, and a public share URL.

---

## Part 3: Handle Partial Failures (5 minutes)

Sometimes one or more models fail while others succeed. Research Agent holds processing in `awaiting_confirmation` status and requires the user to decide what to do.

### Step 3.1: Detect a Partial Failure

When polling, check for `awaiting_confirmation`:

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/$RESEARCH_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  | jq '{
      status: .data.status,
      partialFailure: .data.partialFailure
    }'
```

**Response when partial failure occurs:**

```json
{
  "status": "awaiting_confirmation",
  "partialFailure": {
    "failedModels": ["or:anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6"],
    "detectedAt": "2026-03-15T10:05:00.000Z",
    "retryCount": 0
  }
}
```

### Step 3.2: Confirm the Decision

Send a confirmation with one of three decisions:

| Decision  | Meaning                                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `proceed` | Synthesize using only the successful models      |
| `retry`   | Re-run the failed models before synthesizing     |
| `cancel`  | Mark the research as failed                      |

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/$RESEARCH_ID/confirm" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "decision": "proceed" }' | jq .
```

After `proceed`, the research moves to `synthesizing` and completes normally using the successful models only.

---

## Part 4: Browse OpenRouter Models (5 minutes)

With an OpenRouter credential resolved by user-service, you can access 16 curated frontier models from 10 providers.

### Step 4.1: List Available Models

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/openrouter/models" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq '.data.models[] | {id, name, provider, contextLength}'
```

**Expected response (partial):**

```json
{
  "id": "qwen/qwen3.5-plus-02-15",
  "name": "Qwen 3.5 Plus",
  "provider": "Qwen",
  "contextLength": 1000000
}
{
  "id": "x-ai/grok-4.20-beta",
  "name": "Grok 4.20 Beta",
  "provider": "xAI",
  "contextLength": 2000000
}
```

### Step 4.2: Submit Research with OpenRouter Models

OpenRouter models use the `or:` prefix in the selectedModels array:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Compare React Server Components vs traditional SSR approaches",
    "selectedModels": ["or:google/gemini-3.6-flash", "or:x-ai/grok-4.20-beta", "or:qwen/qwen3.5-plus-02-15"],
    "synthesisModel": "or:minimax/minimax-m3"
  }' | jq .
```

### What Just Happened?

The research was submitted with Google, xAI, and Qwen models routed through OpenRouter. All three run in parallel through the same pipeline. Model IDs are validated against the curated allowlist at execution time. Raw `gemini-*` IDs are rejected; Google models must use `or:google/...`.

---

## Part 5: Enhance an Existing Research (10 minutes)

Enhancement lets you expand a completed research without re-running models that already succeeded.

### Step 5.1: Add a New Model and Context

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/$RESEARCH_ID/enhance" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "additionalModels": ["or:x-ai/grok-4.20-beta"],
    "additionalContexts": [
      {
        "content": "Our current stack: Node.js backend, 50k users, 10TB data, heavy write workload.",
        "label": "Current Architecture"
      }
    ]
  }' | jq '.data.id'
```

**Expected response:** A new research ID. The enhanced research:

- Copies completed LLM results from the source (marked `copiedFromSource: true`)
- Runs only `or:x-ai/grok-4.20-beta` against the original prompt plus the new context
- Re-synthesizes with all results combined
- Tracks source costs separately in `sourceLlmCostUsd`

### Step 5.2: Poll and Read the Enhanced Result

Use the new research ID from Step 5.1:

```bash
export ENHANCED_ID="res_enhanced456"

# Poll until complete
while true; do
  STATUS=$(curl -s "$BASE_URL/$ENHANCED_ID" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq -r '.data.status')
  echo "Status: $STATUS"
  [ "$STATUS" = "completed" ] && break
  sleep 5
done

# Read result
curl -s "$BASE_URL/$ENHANCED_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  | jq '{
      title: .data.title,
      sourceResearchId: .data.sourceResearchId,
      totalCostUsd: .data.totalCostUsd,
      sourceLlmCostUsd: .data.sourceLlmCostUsd
    }'
```

**Result:** `sourceLlmCostUsd` shows how much was reused from the original; `totalCostUsd` includes both old and new costs.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                          | Solution                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `401 Unauthorized`               | Your bearer token is expired — refresh it via the web app login flow                                               |
| `404 Not Found`                  | The research ID does not exist or belongs to a different user                                                      |
| Status stuck at `processing`     | Check Pub/Sub subscription delivery — the LLM call topic may be backlogged                                         |
| Status `failed`, all models down | The OpenRouter credential is unavailable or invalid — check user-service credential resolution                   |
| `enhance` returns `NO_CHANGES`   | You must provide at least one of: additionalModels, additionalContexts, synthesisModel change, or removeContextIds |
| Notion export not appearing      | Confirm `POST /settings/notion` was called with a valid page ID                                           |
| OpenRouter models endpoint 404   | No user or platform OpenRouter credential resolved — check user-service configuration                             |
| OpenRouter model rejected        | The model ID is not on the curated allowlist — check `GET /openrouter/models` for valid IDs               |

---

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics:

1. Configure Notion export via `POST /settings/notion` to get automatic research archiving
2. Explore the draft workflow — use `POST /draft` to create a review-before-run flow
3. Use `POST /validate-input` to check prompt quality before submitting
4. Read the [Technical Reference](technical.md) for full API schemas and the complete status lifecycle
5. See how [Intex](../intex-agent/technical.md) creates draft research from WhatsApp text conversations

## Exercises

Test your understanding:

1. **Easy:** List all your researches and find the one with the highest `totalCostUsd`
2. **Medium:** Submit a research with `skipSynthesis: true` — observe what status it reaches and why the result differs from a normal research
3. **Hard:** Submit a research with three OpenRouter models, induce one model-specific failure in a controlled test environment, then test all three confirmation decisions — `proceed`, `retry`, and `cancel` — and observe the resulting status transitions

<summary>Solutions</summary>

### Exercise 1: Highest-Cost Research

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  | jq '[.data.items[]] | sort_by(.totalCostUsd // 0) | reverse | first | {id, title, totalCostUsd}'
```

### Exercise 2: Skip Synthesis

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "What is dependency injection?",
    "selectedModels": ["or:google/gemini-3.6-flash"],
    "synthesisModel": "or:minimax/minimax-m3",
    "skipSynthesis": true
  }' | jq .
```

With `skipSynthesis: true`, the research reaches `completed` after the single model call, with no `synthesizedResult`. The single LLM result is directly accessible in `llmResults[0].result`.

### Exercise 3: Mixed Models with Partial Failure

In a controlled test environment, make one selected OpenRouter model return a model-specific failure while the others succeed. Submit a three-model research. When `awaiting_confirmation` appears, test:

- `"decision": "proceed"` -> synthesizes with the successful models
- `"decision": "retry"` -> re-queues the failed model; status goes to `retrying`
- `"decision": "cancel"` -> status transitions to `failed`
