# Fishing Assistant Service

User-scoped fishing chat and knowledge-base service for grounded answers over saved fishing notes, digest summaries, and raw group messages.

## The Problem

Fishing knowledge in IntexuraOS is split across manually saved notes, WhatsApp digest history, and recent group messages. Users need a chat surface that can answer fishing questions while preserving source traceability.

## How It Helps

The service stores per-user knowledge folders and pages, indexes page chunks with embeddings, persists chat sessions and messages, and retrieves supporting evidence before generating a cited answer. Its compatibility digest views read canonical history from `message-digest-service`, while supporting source-message evidence comes from the scoped private WhatsApp API.

## Recent Changes

Since v3.8.0, Fishing digest views and retrieval use Message Digest Service for migrated Fishing summaries and WhatsApp Service for bounded private source evidence. The existing Fishing digest URLs remain compatibility views, not a browser for every custom digest. Chat and embeddings now use OpenRouter, preserving stored embedding aliases and dimensions.

## Release 3.7.0 Highlights

- Added the Fishing Assistant RAG foundation: knowledge folders, knowledge pages, page chunking, OpenRouter embeddings, Firestore vector search, and chat endpoints. The persisted embedding alias remains `text-embedding-3-small`. (PRs #2038, #2054)
- Added persisted chat history retrieval through `/chats`, `/chats/:chatId`, and `/chats/:chatId/messages`; new answers receive recent chat messages in the prompt. (PR #2091)
- Strengthened citation validation by aliasing prompt source IDs and remapping citations back to canonical source IDs before storing assistant messages. (PR #2074)
- Prioritized knowledge-base evidence over digest/raw-message context and requires a knowledge-page citation when knowledge evidence is available. (PR #2104)
- Normalized response timestamps to ISO strings for chats, messages, folders, and pages so the web client receives stable dates. (PR #2068)
- Supported the Fishing Assistant web UI and mobile fixes through the chat, knowledge, and digest endpoint surface; the responsive layout fixes live in `apps/web`. (PRs #2054, #2073, #2105)

## Use Cases

### Ask a Grounded Fishing Question

**User Goal:** Get a practical fishing answer backed by stored sources.

**Steps:**
1. Create or select a chat.
2. Send a message to `/chats/:chatId/messages`.
3. Read the assistant reply, confidence, and citations returned in the stored assistant message.

### Maintain a Personal Knowledge Base

**User Goal:** Save fishing recipes, guides, species notes, or theory pages for later retrieval.

**Steps:**
1. Create a folder.
2. Add a page with raw text.
3. Let the service normalize, classify, chunk, embed, and store the page.
4. Reindex the page after edits when needed.

### Browse Digest Context

**User Goal:** Inspect the migrated Fishing group history from the canonical Message Digest store.

**Steps:**
1. List digest groups with `/digest-groups`.
2. Query digests for a group and date range with `/digests`.
3. Load a digest detail with `/digests/:groupKey/:date`.

## Key Benefits

**Grounded answers** - Chat responses are based on retrieved knowledge, digest, and raw-message evidence rather than free-form model output alone.

**Source validation** - Assistant citations must reference known evidence source IDs, and knowledge-base evidence is treated as the authoritative answer base when present.

**Conversation continuity** - Chat sessions and messages are stored per user and reused as recent prompt context for follow-up questions.

**Stable UI contracts** - Response serializers convert Firestore timestamps to ISO strings for the web client.

## Limitations

**OpenRouter access required for chat** - Chat generation uses the user's OpenRouter key when present and the platform fallback otherwise. Missing access returns a `NO_API_KEY` error.

**Knowledge indexing depends on embeddings** - Knowledge pages can be stored with `indexingStatus: failed` when embedding generation fails.

**Folder deletion is blocked when pages exist** - A folder containing pages returns `FOLDER_NOT_EMPTY` on delete.

**No Pub/Sub contract** - The service exposes HTTP endpoints only.
