## Critical Rules and Constraints

1. Do not invent Fishing Assistant endpoints; route files define the current HTTP surface.
2. Treat all folder, page, chat, and message access as user-scoped. Repositories check `userId` before returning data.
3. Chat generation uses the user's OpenRouter key or platform fallback; missing access is a handled `NO_API_KEY` error.
4. Knowledge pages are authoritative evidence when present; digest and raw-message evidence are supporting context.
5. Assistant citations must reference known evidence source IDs. Prompt aliases are remapped before storage.
6. Firestore timestamps in route responses are serialized to ISO strings.
7. Use `logIncomingRequest()` on new routes and keep `bodyPreviewLength: 0` for raw message/page text bodies.

## Storage Ownership

- `fishing_knowledge_folders`
- `fishing_knowledge_pages`
- `fishing_knowledge_chunks`
- `fishing_chats`
- `fishing_chat_messages`

## Dependencies

- Firestore repositories in `src/infra/firestore`.
- OpenRouter embeddings through `src/infra/llm/embeddingClient.ts`, preserving the `text-embedding-3-small` persisted alias and 1536 dimensions.
- Fixed chat model adapter in `src/infra/llm/fixedGeminiFlashClient.ts`.
- user-service for user/platform OpenRouter resolution.
- message-digest-service for the migrated Fishing definition and canonical summary history.
- whatsapp-service for definition-scoped private source-message evidence.
- llm-usage-service through `HttpInternalAuthUsageSink`.

## Usage Patterns

**User Request:** "Add a fishing note and ask a question about it."

**Agent Action:**

```json
{
  "service": "fishing-assistant-service",
  "steps": [
    { "method": "POST", "path": "/folders", "body": { "name": "Notes" } },
    { "method": "POST", "path": "/pages", "body": { "folderId": "folder-id", "rawText": "source text" } },
    { "method": "POST", "path": "/chats" },
    { "method": "POST", "path": "/chats/chat-id/messages", "body": { "message": "question" } }
  ]
}
```

**User Request:** "Show me what the assistant said earlier."

**Agent Action:**

```json
{
  "service": "fishing-assistant-service",
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/chats/chat-id/messages"
}
```
