# App Settings Service — Technical Reference

## Overview

App-settings-service is a Fastify-based microservice running on Cloud Run (port 8122 locally). As of v3.6.0, all LLM pricing and usage cost functionality has been migrated to `llm-usage-service`. The service retains its infrastructure scaffolding (Sentry, CORS, health checks, OpenAPI) but has no business endpoints or domain logic.

## API Endpoints

### System Endpoints

| Method | Path            | Purpose        | Auth |
| ------ | --------------- | -------------- | ---- |
| GET    | `/health`       | Health check   | None |
| GET    | `/openapi.json` | OpenAPI spec   | None |
| GET    | `/docs`         | Swagger UI     | None |

There are no public or internal business endpoints. All pricing endpoints (`/settings/pricing`, `/internal/settings/pricing`) and usage cost endpoints were removed in v3.6.0.

## Domain Model

Empty. The `domain/ports/index.ts` file exports nothing. All pricing-related domain models (ProviderPricing, ModelPricing, AggregatedCosts) were removed with the migration to `llm-usage-service`.

## Pub/Sub

None. The service neither publishes nor subscribes to any Pub/Sub topics.

## Dependencies

### Internal Services

None. The service does not call any other services.

### Infrastructure

| Dependency | Purpose                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Firestore  | Health check connectivity verification   |
| SentryBox  | Error tracking and log streaming         |

### Dependent Services

These services poll `/health` before starting (configured in `ecosystem.config.cjs`):

| Service        | Why                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| user-service   | Startup dependency (waitForService)            |
| intex-agent    | Startup dependency (waitForService)            |
| research-agent | Startup dependency (waitForService)            |

### Service Catalog

Api-docs-hub registers app-settings-service in its OpenAPI source catalog.

| `@intexuraos/http-contracts`  | Core JSON schemas                     |
| `@intexuraos/http-server`     | Health checks, env validation         |
| `@intexuraos/infra-firestore` | Firestore client singleton            |
| `@intexuraos/infra-sentry`    | Sentry init, app logger, log stream   |
| `@intexuraos/llm-contract`    | Unused (stale dependency)             |

## Gotchas

- **Several services still depend on this service's health endpoint.** Removing or decommissioning the service requires updating `ecosystem.config.cjs` `waitForService` entries for user-service, intex-agent, and research-agent.
- **Empty service container.** `ServiceContainer` is typed as `Record<string, never>` — it holds no adapters. The DI wiring (`getServices`, `setServices`, `resetServices`) exists but is unused.
- **No test files.** All test files were removed with the pricing migration. The service currently has no test coverage.
- **Firestore collection still registered.** The `settings` collection is registered in `firestore-collections.json` with `app-settings-service` as owner, but nothing in the service code reads or writes it.
- **`@intexuraos/llm-contract` still in dependencies.** The `package.json` lists `@intexuraos/llm-contract` as a dependency, but no source file imports it.
