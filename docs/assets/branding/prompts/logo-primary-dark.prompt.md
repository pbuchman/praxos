Create a professional, minimalist logo for a system called "IntexuraOS".

System meaning:
IntexuraOS is an execution and automation system operating on top of structured human decisions.
It represents determinism, orchestration, and controlled execution.
This is infrastructure-level software, not a consumer application.

Absolute framing requirement (critical):

- The logo must tightly fill the canvas.
- Symbol and logotype must occupy 80–90% of the available space.
- Minimal margins on all sides.
- No poster-style or hero-image spacing.

Composition:

- Square canvas.
- Dense, compact, vertically centered composition.
- Symbol above or tightly integrated with the logotype "IntexuraOS".
- Strong alignment and mechanical precision.

Symbol direction:

- Abstract execution engine or system core.
- Layered or modular geometry representing orchestration.
- Clean geometric shapes only.
- No mascots, no illustrations, no metaphors (brains, robots, gears, faces).

Visual style:

- Flat, vector-like design.
- Sharp edges.
- No gradients, glow, blur, or decorative effects.

Color palette (dark):

- Background: near-black or charcoal.
- Primary shapes: white or light gray.
- Single accent color only: cyan or teal.
- Accent used sparingly.

Typography:

- Modern geometric sans-serif.
- Technical, restrained, system-like.
- Subtle emphasis on "OS" is acceptable.

Overall impression:
Dense, engineered, controlled, trustworthy.

Deliver:
A square logo suitable for GitHub avatars, documentation headers, and system diagrams.
