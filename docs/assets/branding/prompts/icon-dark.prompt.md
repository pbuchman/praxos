Create a square application icon for a system called "PraxOS".

Important:

- ICON ONLY. No text, no letters, no logotype.
- The icon must tightly fill the canvas.
- At least 85–95% of the canvas should be occupied.
- Minimal margins on all sides.
- Must remain readable at 32x32 and 64x64 sizes.

System meaning:
PraxOS represents deterministic execution, orchestration, and system control.
This is infrastructure software, not a consumer application.

Icon concept:

- Abstract system core or execution engine.
- Layered or modular geometry.
- Strong central mass.
- Symmetry or near-symmetry preferred.

Design constraints:

- Flat, vector-like design.
- Sharp edges and precise geometry.
- No gradients, glow, mascots, illustrations, or decorative effects.

Color palette (dark):

- Background: near-black or charcoal.
- Foreground: white or light gray.
- Single accent color only: cyan or teal.

Overall impression:
Technical, controlled, deterministic, trustworthy.

Deliver:
A tightly framed square icon suitable for GitHub avatars and application icons.
