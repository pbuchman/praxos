# Intex Agent Evaluation Runbook

The exact operator procedure for the canonical live Matrix/WhatsApp run, including the
phone-visible message flow and browser acceptance checklist, is documented in
[`intex-agent-matrix-whatsapp-live-procedure.md`](./intex-agent-matrix-whatsapp-live-procedure.md).

## Scope and safety

The evaluator process and its protected Matrix credentials run only on the Linux host
`home-dev`, from `$HOME/deploy/intexuraos`, through the SSH alias `home-dev`. The
system under test is exclusively the Hetzner production deployment at
`https://intexuraos.cloud`, with runtime audience `hetzner-prod`. Its WhatsApp Service,
Intex Agent, webhook ingress, sessions, LLM calls, strict mocks, and Test Runs are all
production processes. The runner reaches the two corpus-only control planes through
Google-OIDC-protected `/internal/evals/...` routes; it never falls back to Home Dev
service ports. The fixed Home Dev ports Intex Agent `8134`, WhatsApp Service `8113`,
and Matrix adapter `8099` belong only to legacy diagnostics and local Matrix transport.

`matrix-corpus` is the canonical live acceptance command. It runs the tracked corpus of
20 scenarios and 60 turns sequentially through the real Matrix/WhatsApp transport. Each
scenario starts a labelled Intex session and all later turns stay bound to that exact
session. The agent model is locked to `or:deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`; product tools run
only through the strict mock boundary, while `or:minimax/minimax-m3` evaluates assistant
replies. Missing credentials, a timeout, invalid output, owner-cleanup failure, or provider
failure is an infrastructure failure with exit `2`; there is no fallback model, judge,
transport, or production tool execution.

The preflight embedded in `matrix-corpus` is read-only: it sends no message, calls no LLM,
creates no run or artifact, and performs no Firestore, Pub/Sub, or filesystem write. Only
after preflight passes may the command provision the run and send the first Matrix message.
It also reads the live Firestore index control plane through the authenticated, read-only
Firestore Admin REST API and requires all eight Matrix-corpus composite indexes to report
`READY`; a missing, incompatible, or still-building index closes admission.

`endpoint`, `scenario`, `matrix-smoke`, and `full` remain diagnostics for the legacy
evaluator path. They are not substitutes for the 20-scenario Matrix corpus and are not
part of its normal acceptance sequence.

Preparation commands never run the wrapper. Every wrapper command below is **LIVE**.
One explicit instruction “odpal testy”, or an active persistent goal that requires
iteration until PASS, authorizes the production corpus loop. `endpoint`, `scenario`,
`matrix-smoke`, `full`, and the execution phase of `matrix-corpus` can invoke paid LLM
calls. The embedded production preflight does not.

## Protected machine-local configuration

The configuration exists only on Home Dev at
`~/.config/intexuraos/intex-agent-evals.json`. Its parent directory must be a
current-UID-owned, non-symlink directory with exact mode `0700`. The configuration
must be a current-UID-owned, non-symlink regular file with exact mode `0600`.
Its strict structure is:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "accountAlias": "operator-test",
  "userId": "canonical-firebase-uid",
  "matrixUserId": "@matrix-user:homeserver.example",
  "matrixAccessTokenFile": "/absolute/protected/matrix-token",
  "matrixOutboundAuthTokenFile": "/absolute/protected/matrix-outbound-auth-token",
  "matrixTargetsFile": "/absolute/protected/matrix-targets.json"
}
```

All three referenced paths must be absolute. The two tokens and targets must each be a
current-UID-owned, non-symlink regular file with exact mode `0600` and bounded size.
`matrixAccessTokenFile` contains one non-empty Matrix homeserver access token.
`matrixOutboundAuthTokenFile` is distinct from `matrixAccessTokenFile` and contains the
separate adapter-local bearer; the files and their token values must not be reused.
`GET http://127.0.0.1:8099/health` requires `Authorization: Bearer` with that outbound
token. The targets file has this strict shape:

```json
{
  "matrix-source-account-id": {
    "intex_agent": "!room-id:homeserver.example"
  }
}
```

The top-level key must match Matrix adapter health `sourceAccountId`;
setup/preflight select only its `intex_agent` room. Never add a real UID, e-mail,
phone number, Matrix identity, room, token, protected absolute operator path, or
account data to Git.

The ignored Home Dev `.envrc.local` additionally contains
`INTEXURAOS_MATRIX_CORPUS_MATRIX_PUPPET_USER_ID`, set to the exact current WhatsApp
puppet Matrix user visible in that room. This binding is deliberately separate from
the WhatsApp webhook account and sender bindings. Preflight requires the configured
puppet to appear in the room timeline and ignores unrelated historical puppets; the
value must never be committed or printed.

`setup` is interactive and reads all six values without echo. Only the validated
`accountAlias` can appear afterward in the closed setup result. The current Home Dev
operator account is already configured, so normal execution never invokes `setup` and
never asks the user for identity values. `CONFIG_NOT_FOUND` is an unexpected protected
configuration failure: stop and restore the known machine-local configuration, or run
`setup` only after separate authorization.

### Version-one configuration upgrade

A protected file with the exact legacy `schemaVersion: 1` shape is recognized
and reported as `CONFIG_UPGRADE_REQUIRED`; it is not collapsed into `CONFIG_INVALID`.
Run `scripts/run-intex-agent-evals-home-dev.sh setup` and enter the existing five values
plus the distinct `matrixOutboundAuthTokenFile`. After the candidate and referenced
credentials pass all readiness checks, setup verifies that every legacy field is unchanged,
holds an exclusive same-directory mode-`0600` upgrade lock, creates and fsyncs a protected
staging file, and atomically replaces the protected version-one file. The publish fsyncs the containing directory before reporting success.
Setup and preflight require the upgrade lock to remain absent across their protected
configuration read, so neither can accept an in-progress publish. After the durable publish,
setup fsyncs the directory again after removing the upgrade lock.
Success is the closed line
`setup result PASS upgraded`; then run
`scripts/run-intex-agent-evals-home-dev.sh preflight`. A changed legacy field, concurrent
replacement, unsafe file, or failed publish leaves a closed failure and never prints the
configuration, paths, or tokens. A lock left by an interrupted upgrade remains a fail-closed
conflict; verify that no setup process is active before removing that single upgrade lock and
retrying `setup`.

## Tracked inputs and private outputs

Tracked scenarios live at
`tools/intex-agent-evals/scenarios/*.scenario.json`. Evaluation reports remain on
Home Dev below
`$HOME/deploy/intexuraos/.artifacts/intex-agent-evals/<eval-run-id>/`. Each
evaluation command atomically publishes mode-`0600` `report.json` and `report.md`
inside a mode-`0700` run directory. `setup` and `preflight` write no report.

The wrapper prints only the safe relative path
`.artifacts/intex-agent-evals/<eval-run-id>`. The ignored reports stay on Home Dev;
the wrapper does not copy them to the workstation.

Before connecting, the wrapper requires clean evaluator implementation paths and passes
the workstation's exact 40-character `HEAD` only as revision proof. On Home Dev it
requires that revision to equal the runner repository `HEAD`; the embedded preflight
then requires the same revision in the production
`https://intexuraos.cloud/deployment.json` attestation. It enters the fixed repository,
verifies `direnv` and `node`, preserves remote exits `0`, `1`, and `2`, and forwards only
safe CLI output.

The CLI report, not the wrapper, records preflight checks; scenario, turn, reply,
and tool totals; deterministic and MiniMax verdicts; cleanup counts; Matrix
transport facts; duration; aggregate token counts; and provider-reported USD. The
terminal and reports retain no prompts, replies, rationale, credentials, protected
paths, raw errors, or real identifiers.

For a passing canonical run, report validation requires 20 unique session-reference
digests, 60 correlated turns/replies, the tracked 17 confirmation decisions, the exact
19-row strict-mock tool schedule, reconciled DeepSeek/MiniMax usage, and successful ready
artifact cleanup/release gates. `sessionsClosed` remains `0` because session-close state is
not part of the current safe evidence projection; it must not be inferred from scenario
lifecycle. The strict-mock proof is derived from one persisted execution-boundary event per
terminal turn, including the explicit `no_executor_required` outcome for a rejected
confirmation, rather than from a report-side declaration.

## Exact commands

The following preparation commands are offline and safe during Phase 1:

```bash
pnpm --filter @intexuraos/intex-agent-evals validate
pnpm --filter @intexuraos/intex-agent-evals test
pnpm exec vitest run apps/intex-agent/src/__tests__/routes/testConversationRoutes.test.ts
pnpm run ci:tracked
```

**LIVE — requires “odpal testy”**

```bash
scripts/run-intex-agent-evals-home-dev.sh setup
scripts/run-intex-agent-evals-home-dev.sh preflight
scripts/run-intex-agent-evals-home-dev.sh endpoint
scripts/run-intex-agent-evals-home-dev.sh scenario intex-eval-003
scripts/run-intex-agent-evals-home-dev.sh matrix-smoke
scripts/run-intex-agent-evals-home-dev.sh full
scripts/run-intex-agent-evals-prod.sh matrix-corpus
```

The repository alias for the same canonical live operation is:

```bash
pnpm eval:intex-agent:matrix-corpus
```

The production wrapper accepts only `matrix-corpus`. The Home Dev wrapper retains
`setup`, `preflight`, `endpoint`, `full`, `scenario intex-eval-NNN`, and `matrix-smoke`.
While the retained DEV profile has `MODE=hibernated`, every one of those legacy selectors exits
before the checkout, `direnv`, or evaluator with the stable result `DEV_RUNTIME_HIBERNATED`.
Running one requires the separately reviewed DEV resume workflow; never resume DEV merely to
replace the supported production acceptance path. The private Home Dev transport used by the
production `matrix-corpus` wrapper is exempt because it targets the production runtime and does
not start DEV services.
`scripts/run-intex-agent-evals-home-dev.sh matrix-corpus` exits before Git, SSH, or any
message send with `PRODUCTION_MATRIX_CORPUS_REQUIRED`.
`scenario`, `endpoint`, `matrix-smoke`, and `full` are targeted legacy
diagnostics, not additional matrix-corpus acceptance steps.

The instruction **“odpal testy” means exactly one invocation of `matrix-corpus`**.
For a single requested run, do not prepend a separate `preflight`, `endpoint`, `full`, or
`matrix-smoke`; the canonical command contains its own zero-side-effect production
preflight. Under a persistent “iterate until PASS” goal, exit `1` or `2` starts the
diagnosis/fix/review/PR/merge/deploy loop and then exactly one new invocation. The wrapper
itself performs no pull, deploy, restart, or revision switch.

For behavioral failures, the corpus runner records and judges the failed turn, skips only
the remaining turns that depend on that scenario's now-divergent state, and continues
with every later scenario through scenario 20. This produces one complete cross-scenario
failure inventory per run instead of stopping at the first broken flow. A successful run
still executes all 60 turns. Do not implement behavioral fixes between scenarios: finish
the run, review the complete inventory, and correct the collected behavioral failures as
one batch before the next production run.

## Deliberately deferred hardening

The runner is intentionally Home-Dev-specific, while the system under test is production
Hetzner. A portable account bootstrap, automatic registration of dedicated
e-mail/WhatsApp test identities, cross-machine configuration distribution, and production
scheduling remain future hardening; private operator identities stay only in the
protected local configuration.

Live evidence proves that every scenario has a distinct bound session and that its later
turns continue that binding. It does not yet expose every internal session-transition and
timeline field through the privacy-safe evidence DTO; those fields remain `not_observed`
rather than being inferred from expectations. Extending that DTO is the remaining path to
full internal-transition attestation.

Steady-state retention reconciles every superseded run returned by the bounded four-run
plan during the new provisioning lease. Each target is removed through its own
owner-authorized exact-run/fence cleanup before the next target starts; any failure stops
the sequence, and the runner never falls back to a user-wide delete.

## Exit codes and triage

| Exit | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | All executed deterministic and MiniMax checks passed. | Preserve report path and continue. |
| `1` | Behavioral failure. | Preserve the report, correct the failed scenarios, deploy, and automatically run the production corpus again. |
| `2` | Configuration, revision, connectivity, cleanup, judge, Matrix, or reporting infrastructure failure. | Preserve safe code/output, correct the named boundary, deploy, and automatically run the production corpus again. |

Triage only from the safe terminal code and report fields. Never paste protected
configuration, raw provider or endpoint bodies, assistant text, Matrix history,
tokens, or protected paths.

`revision_mismatch` means that the reviewed revision is not simultaneously present in the
Home Dev runner checkout and the production Hetzner deployment attestation. Complete the
normal merge/deployment and update the runner checkout through the established deployment
workflow; never bypass revision proof. A missing protected runner configuration is
repaired from the already-established machine-local state rather than by asking again for
known account values.
