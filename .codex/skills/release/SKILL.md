# Release Skill

Use this skill to prepare an IntexuraOS release.

## Usage

```text
$release                    # Full release workflow
$release --skip-docs        # Skip service documentation
$release --phase 3          # Resume from a specific phase
$release --collect          # Only collect and triage release data
```

## Codex Execution Model

- Use subagent-driven execution first whenever Codex subagent tools are available.
- Before Phase 1, create a short release execution plan and use the `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` pattern: bounded subagent tasks, controller integration, spec/quality review loops for mutating work, and final controller verification.
- Fall back to current-session execution only when subagent tools are unavailable; report that fallback before continuing.
- Do not create git worktrees for this repo. `AGENTS.md` forbids worktrees, so all release work stays in the active checkout while subagents use their normal forked workspaces.
- Former release-agent instructions live in `reference/agent-prompts.md`; use them as subagent task prompts by default.
- Use the existing `$share` skill or the explicit GCS upload commands in the workflow when publishing the prioritizer page.
- Read and follow the repository `AGENTS.md` before taking project actions.

## Invocation Detection

| Argument      | Workflow                            | What Happens                                                                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| none          | `workflows/full-release.md`         | Full release workflow                                                                      |
| `--skip-docs` | `workflows/full-release.md`         | Full release workflow, skipping service documentation                                      |
| `--phase N`   | `workflows/full-release.md`         | Resume from Phase N                                                                        |
| `--collect`   | `workflows/collect-release-data.md` | Separate pipeline: collect release data, triage it, write `.prerelease-data.md`, then stop |

`--collect` is not a modifier of the full release workflow. It runs the collection pipeline and exits. The full workflow can later consume `.prerelease-data.md` when it is fresh for the current HEAD.

## Core Mandates

1. Feature prioritization happens once in Phase 1 using the interactive prioritizer page.
2. Notable changes and minor fixes bypass the prioritizer and are automatically included in the changelog unless netted out.
3. Service documentation runs silently through bounded subagent tasks by default.
4. `pnpm run ci:tracked` must pass before any release commit.
5. All package versions must stay synchronized across root, apps, packages, and workers.
6. Finalization must use a feature branch and a PR targeting `development`; do not commit directly to `development` or `main`.
7. Tags must point to a commit contained in `origin/main`.
8. GitHub Release notes must mirror the sorted CHANGELOG categories.
9. Post-release validation must verify tag, release, changelog, package versions, and branch state.

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Name            | Interaction | Key Actions                                                                                      |
| ----- | --------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0     | Subagent Plan   | Automatic   | Build the subagent-driven execution plan and choose fallback only if tools are unavailable       |
| 1     | Kickoff         | User Input  | Analyze semver, create prioritizer page, parse user priorities                                   |
| 2     | Service Docs    | Silent      | Update service docs through bounded workers and validate factual accuracy                        |
| 3     | High-Level Docs | Automatic   | Update `docs/overview.md`, README badges, and `docs/services/index.md`                           |
| 4     | README          | Automatic   | Generate or update README "What's New" from highlighted release features                         |
| 5     | Website         | Automatic   | Update homepage version strings and `WhatsNewSection`                                            |
| 6     | Finalize        | Automatic   | Sync versions, update changelog, run CI, commit on feature branch, open PR, tag main after merge |

## Tool Verification

Before release operations, verify required tools:

| Tool       | Verification Command | Purpose                 |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Git        | `git --version`      | Version control         |
| GitHub CLI | `gh auth status`     | PR and release actions  |
| Node.js    | `node --version`     | Package scripts         |
| gsutil     | `gsutil version`     | Prioritizer page upload |
| jq         | `jq --version`       | JSON transforms         |

If any required tool is unavailable, stop and report the failing tool, purpose, and fix.
