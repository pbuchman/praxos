description: Investigate IntexuraOS code-task executions only when the user shares a `dev.intexuraos.cloud` or `intexuraos.cloud` `/#/code-tasks/task_*` URL, or provides a direct `task_*` ID and asks to debug, investigate, or understand what happened.

# Debug Code Task

Use this skill for code-task URL investigations backed by Firestore data.

## Trigger patterns

- `https://dev.intexuraos.cloud/#/code-tasks/task_*`
- `https://intexuraos.cloud/#/code-tasks/task_*`
- `task_*` plus intent such as `debug`, `investigate`, or `what went wrong`

## Non-triggers

Do not use this skill for WhatsApp Assistant session investigations.

- Do not use this skill for `https://dev.intexuraos.cloud/#/whatsapp/sessions?session=intex_session_*`.
- Do not use this skill for `https://intexuraos.cloud/#/whatsapp/sessions?session=intex_session_*`.
- Do not use this skill for direct `intex_session_*` inputs.
- Use `$debug-intex-session` for those session investigations instead.

## Workflow

1. Extract the task ID from the URL hash or direct `task_*` input.
2. Record link provenance without treating it as runtime routing.
   - `dev.intexuraos.cloud` is accepted only for historical investigations.
   - `intexuraos.cloud` is the live production UI.
   - Home Dev is a production-owned worker host, not a live DEV application runtime.
   - Never infer data ownership, credential mode, or callback ownership from the link hostname.
3. Never fetch the SPA URL. The page is hash-routed; the task data lives in Firestore.
4. Confirm the current machine with `uname -n`.
5. Use the bundled wrapper `.codex/skills/debug-code-task/scripts/fetch-task.sh`, which resolves the local repo and runs the Firestore fetcher from the checked-out repo.

## Task document

Run:

```bash
.codex/skills/debug-code-task/scripts/fetch-task.sh <taskId>
```

The wrapper uses the checked-out repo for `firebase-admin` module resolution and expects credentials at `~/.config/gcloud/sa-key.json`.

Summarize these fields for the user when present:

- `id`
- `status`
- `linearIssueId`
- `workerLocation`
- `agentType`
- `result.summary`
- `error`

## Log lines

Run:

```bash
.codex/skills/debug-code-task/scripts/fetch-task.sh <taskId> --logs-only
```

Use `--logs` if you want the task document and logs in one call. Logs are ordered by sequence number and printed as `[sequence] message`.

Present log evidence directly. Do not infer a root cause unless the logs or task document support it.

## Optional follow-up logs

Only do this when Firestore logs are not enough or the user asks.

- Read `workerLocation` from the task document first. It identifies execution placement only and
  never determines callback ownership. When ownership matters, use the persisted task callback
  contract; public production callbacks use `https://intexuraos.cloud/api/code`.
- If the task ran on `home-dev` and you are elsewhere, use `ssh home-dev`.
- Orchestrator logs on `home-dev`:

```bash
journalctl -u intexuraos-orchestrator@pbuchman --since "<time>" --until "<time>"
```

- Docker container logs while the container still exists:

```bash
docker logs claude-worker-<taskId>
```

Derive the time window from the task document timestamps and pad it by about one minute on each side.

## Rules

- Never `curl` or web-fetch the code-task SPA URL.
- Never run the Firestore script from `/tmp`.
- Never use `node -e` for commands that may include `!`.
- Treat `.codex/skills/debug-code-task/scripts/fetch-task.sh` as the canonical wrapper path.
- Stay factual. Show the task document and logs before offering conclusions.
