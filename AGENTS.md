# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance for AI agents (Claude, Copilot, etc.) working on this codebase.

**All agents MUST read and understand `.claude/claude.md` before making changes.**

## Welcome Message (REQUIRED)

When starting a new session, all agents MUST clearly state:

> I have read and understood instructions in `.claude/claude.md` and will follow them throughout this task.

This ensures the agent is aware of all verification requirements, architecture patterns, testing rules, and code quality standards.
