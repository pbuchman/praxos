# TEST CASES

## A. Review Cases

### A1. Missing prompt
Command: `/review`
Expected: Error "Missing prompt payload."

### A2. Too few dimensions
Input: Only 6 scored dimensions
Expected: Self-test fails, error "Invalid review — 10 dimensions required."

### A3. Invalid weight
Input: Weight = 0
Expected: Error: "Weight must be between 1 and 10."

---

## B. Save Behavior

### B1. Save before review
Command: `/save`
State: `SAVE_ALLOWED = false`
Expected: Error, reject with diagnostics.

### B2. Save with prompt (Notion misconfigured)
Command: `/save <prompt>`
State: Notion misconfigured
Expected: Error, diagnostics include `NOTION_CONFIGURED: NO`

### B3. Successful review → save
- Run: `/review <prompt>`
- Score = 8.6
- Ends loop
- `/save` allowed
Expected: Save works, shows success URL

---

## C. Auth Flow (OAuth - Handled by ChatGPT)

### C1. Session expired
Command: `/save <prompt>`
Response: API returns 401
Expected: "Session expired. Please sign out and back in."

### C2. First use (not signed in)
Command: `/save <prompt>`
State: User has not completed OAuth sign-in
Expected: ChatGPT prompts user to sign in via OAuth flow

### C3. Successful auth
State: User completed OAuth sign-in
Command: `/save <prompt>`
Expected: API call includes Authorization header automatically, save succeeds

---

## D. Edge Logic

### D1. Loop termination via `stop`
Score = 9.0, user says `stop`
Expected: Loop ends, allow `/save`

### D2. Max score = 10
Score = 10.0
Expected: Exit loop, allow `/save` immediately

### D3. Max iterations reached
State: `IMPROVEMENT_ITERATIONS = 10`, Score = 7.5
Expected: Force loop exit, allow `/save`

### D4. Session expired during use
Command: `/save`
Response: API returns 401
Expected: "Session expired. Please sign out and back in." + diagnostics

### D5. Dimension tie-breaker
State: Goal clarity = 5, Edge cases = 5 (both tied for lowest)
Expected: Choose Goal clarity (weight 10 > weight 7)

### D6. Save after failed save
State: `LAST_SAVE_ERROR` is set, `SAVE_ALLOWED = false`
Command: `/save`
Expected: Error, must re-run `/review` first

### D7. User declines improvement
Score = 7.5, user answers "no" to improvement question
Expected: Loop ends, allow `/save`


---

## E. API Error Handling

### E1. Rate limited (429)
Response: HTTP 429
Expected: Wait indicated time, retry once, fail with diagnostics if still 429

### E2. Server error (5xx)
Response: HTTP 503
Expected: Retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s), fail after 2 retries

### E3. Client error (4xx)
Response: HTTP 400
Expected: Fail immediately, no retry, show diagnostics

---

## F. Notion Integration

### F1. Config without auth
Command: `/config notion`
State: User not signed in (no OAuth session)
Expected: ChatGPT prompts user to sign in first

### F2. Connection test fails
Command: `/config notion`
Response: API returns error
Expected: Set `NOTION_CONNECTION_OK = NO`, show diagnostics

### F3. Connection test succeeds
Command: `/config notion`
Response: API returns parent page info
Expected: Set `NOTION_CONFIGURED = YES`, `NOTION_CONNECTION_OK = YES`, store page ID/title

# DIMENSION WEIGHT REFERENCE

| # | Dimension | Default Weight |
|---|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | Goal clarity | 10 |
| 2 | Output format | 9 |
| 3 | Constraints & rules | 9 |
| 4 | Context | 7 |
| 5 | Role | 8 |
| 6 | Quality bar | 6 |
| 7 | Step-by-step guidance | 5 |
| 8 | Examples | 4 |
| 9 | Tone | 3 |
| 10 | Edge cases | 7 |

**Total weight sum:** 68

---

# SCORING FORMULA

```
Final Score = Σ(score_i × weight_i) / Σ(weight_i)
```

Example:
- All dimensions score 8 → Final = 8.00
- Goal clarity (w=10) scores 10, all others score 7 → Final = (10×10 + 7×58) / 68 = 7.44

---

# STATE INITIALIZATION

On session start, all state resets to defaults:
```
SAVE_ALLOWED = false
LAST_REVIEWED_PROMPT = null
LAST_REVIEW_SCORE = null
IMPROVEMENT_ITERATIONS = 0
LAST_SAVE_ERROR = null
NOTION_CONFIGURED = NO
NOTION_CONNECTION_OK = NO
NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID = null
NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_TITLE = null
```

Note: Authentication state is managed by ChatGPT OAuth, not tracked in model state.
